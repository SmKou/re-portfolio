### Limits of Language

Explorative speculation

- How does language cultivate and limit the thoughts or ideas one could have?
- How does language change over time, and how do dialects form and fade?
- What happens with experiences and ideas one does not have the language for or cannot use language to express?
- Does either the structure or use of language limit the capability to express and comprehend?

**Research:** linguistics, language evolution, (emotional) expression, comprehension, social linguistics, language usage

### Abstraction of Thought, Self and Memory

Explorative self-critique and speculation

- Self is memory
- Creativity is a natural continuous process of memory
- Critical thinking, or the notion of it, is more about virtue and ideals than logic and validity
- When one wants to learn to do, know, or overcome something, the first question is not “How to get it done” but “How does one get themself to do it”
- Perception and perspectives in structure of thought as opposed to thought
- What is thinking?
- To what extent are thinking and feeling the same?
- What is the conceptual difference and so resulting perception of think and thinking?

**Research:** thinking, feeling, self, memory, perception, perspective, creativity, critical thinking

- feeling + feel, sensation
- thinking + think, thought

### Basis of Adaptability and Resilience

- What is resilience, and what is its importance?
