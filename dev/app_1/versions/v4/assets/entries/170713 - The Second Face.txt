Another observation from back in China on 6 Jul 2016.

Yesterday, while on the subway, I saw this ad. It was a man of narrow eyes and combed black hair, eyes dark as he gazed towards the viewer. He had his head tilted, holding up a diamond necklace next to his face, and had his mouth agape as if to bite or pull one of the diamond studs into his mouth. My heart jumped, cause I saw a different face. The gesture and expression was so reminiscent of someone I'm physically attracted to (which is an extreme rarity for me, unfortunately) that I froze for a moment and stared, caught in shock, yet right before my eyes, the picture morphed and I saw the original man in the poster.

Physical attraction is weird. I get drawn to a person or poster simply because they remind me of someone, and I always question, kind of hoping, hoping I'll be attracted to yet another "thing" and wondering if I'm only attracted to 
him...

So far, in my life, I get attracted to men, women, and things like an artist drawn to their next subject or landscape. I feel the need to pursue and capture something, yet never with romantic or physical intent. There have only been two men I have ever seen or met that I've been attracted to physically and one woman romantically. Just to note, I'm not interested in relationships with partners and have never genuinely been interested, only caring for personal gain or 
welfare. So attraction to me is both intriguing and bothersome.

Why would the face in a poster become another though?
