The woman's dress is black with tacky gold embroidery, but her fingernails are an inch long, almost seeming as if they could be longer. She wears rings of gold curling around her fingers in interlaced hearts, a coiled dragon, and stacked triangles. The gold does not glimmer, yet it is bright and I wonder if it's dull and polished because the rings are not old-looking...

I was just thinking I need a men's bag, then I looked up and saw a lithe man in a comfortable pair of blue jeans, a gray-and-blue streaked shirt, and a beige backpack featuring flowers, a girl, and sheep in thin pastel lines. The straps, back, and handles are a light brown, a very warm, almost golden, hue of the typical brown sold in stores. If that was his bag, I guess I needed simply a backpack, or a laptop case with a strap.
