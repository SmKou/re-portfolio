## Description

Re-Portfolio is a static portfolio website, featuring a collection of portfolios. These portfolios are presented as versions and each version has its own design. For example, one may be in the style of a newspaper and another may be in the style of an index. To avoid redundancy of content, some may seem missing from one version to another. Updates will be noted on the homepage.
