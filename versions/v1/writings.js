            'The Woman and the Mountain': `I'm aware of you and somehow, to an extent, you are aware of me. By you, dear reader, I mean someone else. In fact, she turns from me and resumes her trek as I address you instead. Perhaps I should enlighten your expectant imaginations. The woman I was talking to is young in both looks and manner but there is no wondering of the capacity she has for thought and reflection for as we watch her, she has none other than that which is shared with me.

            Though late in her twenties, this woman of fire-like hair, paper white skin and creamy chocolate irises fitted in almond-shaped eyes with long lashes is seen as young, even ageless, and dare I say she is of a semblance to my countenance, or perhaps she is what I used to be at the beginning of my ageless period in life. For this thought, she stops in the middle of the dirt path she has been following and smiles at me as if I were a bird chirping at her from the trees. She purses her lips with a smile, then spins about, whipping her hair at me. Since she is the main prospect of my experiment, I descend to her level and follow behind her as she crosses an old stone bridge covered in moss.
            
            Seeing through her eyes, I feel the awe and wonder of everything. Everything from the smallest flower or pebble to the sweeping beauty of the field, forest and mountains past a little worn down cottage ahead of us inspires her admiration but I suspect, should I add a person to the landscape, appearing over the crest of a small hill on the left side of the field, the young woman's awe dims. She stared at my addition to the landscape and glared back at me. Keeping her head down, she moves in the opposite direction of the stranger, heading for the right side of the field towards the forest. Though I think of uprooting the field into dark, barren soil, imagining her distressed expression, I allow her to walk into the field to feel the bed of grass cushioning her steps as the sunlight breaks through the clouds and illuminates her hair. It is a majestic sight. A halo forms on the crown of her dark roots that fade into varying shades of red, reaching the tips of her blazing golden mane. I never realized how beautiful she could be.
            
            The woman stops and glances back at me but aware that in my direction is the stranger I planted, she looks forward. Speaking of the stranger, whatever their business, they have strode past the worn down cottage and are crossing the old stone bridge. Running under the bridge was such a small stream that I dismissed the bridge from under their feet. With a cry, they fell into the water. Unlike any normal person, the young woman had no immediate reaction to the sound.
            
            However, registering the sound, she turned back and looked at the drenched stranger as they muttered with confusion over their unusual happening. She frowned as she looked at me but then broke out into a wide smile. Anticipating the attention of the stranger who had nothing to look to her for anyway, she spun about and resumed making her way to the forest. In her mind, one brief thought went to the stranger, except she and I were of a kind that ignored the potential bonding formed in the affordance of help given. For her, I wasn't quite certain which of our reasons she ascribed to. Was it the irritation and resentment of humanity that bred the vengeful spirit seeking mental and emotional breakage, or was it the ever pervasive fear of being one's self, wholesome and free, only to be misunderstood, feared and rejected too completely? Whichever it was, the young woman buried it with her determination and fixation.
            
            As the young woman breached the tree line, I stopped and compelled her to stop as well. She faced me with a mix of dread and confusion on her pale face. I looked around at all the greenery surrounding us. This was such an idyllic scene. When my gaze landed back on the young woman, she was frowning.
            
            "Don't," she said.
            
            I was tempted to remind her who was in control here but then I had to remind myself that the whole point of my experiment was to see her. I didn't know what this young woman was, or what she might mean to me, yet in making her, I had given in to the words of another and would so see this experiment through. I was uncomfortable with the thought of letting her wander in the forest and watching her frolic and explore. Maybe that though was part of what I had to allow.
            
            She grinned and peeked up. Crouching, her eyes so full of mischief told me to follow closely. Rather than let myself answer that, I compelled her to run. I thought of her clothes, trying to think of something that might slow or resist her, but with nothing, I was aware of her exuberant smile, her quickening run and the air of freedom that filled my lungs in her wake. The breath that escapes and is stolen for leaps and the ever challenging urge, the smile that opens for laughter and hollers of excitement, the pumping blood, the thumping heart, and the will of a child pursuing fantasy, the distance yawns between us and as unnerved as I am, inside me is an uncomprehending shock. Could a full-grown adult really experience such an unadulterated joy and innocence? Indeed, my mind was uncomprehending.
            
            She stopped somewhere deep in the forest, hidden among the trees and surrounded by all the wonders that nature could offer, of which I was mostly blind. With heaving breath and an unrestrained smile, she gazed at me, though like me, she could no longer make even an inkling of my figure in the distance, and her gaze softened. She turned. "Why," she cried, throwing out her arms and letting them fall to her sides.
            
            I found her, poised among stones and ferns nestled in a jagged indentation in the ground. It stretched on both up the slow rising hill and down as if once there had been a stream here. In all directions, I only saw a ground covered in leaves of varying stages of decomposition. When I met the young woman's gaze, I knew she saw something more real and fascinating but I could not access her mind's eye, or rather I was less than willing to bother. Again, her gaze softened as she regarded me.
            
            I dismissed her pity and resisted the urge to look away from her. She urged me to do just that. I reminded her that it won't work in her favor, that's why we were here in the first place. Her head lowered, as did her shoulders, and she kicked a stone, stealing a glance at me.
            
            As compelled as I was to engage her in conversation and likely interrogate her, or to change the overwhelmingly natural and what many would consider breathtaking landscape, I resisted. I was aware of my irritation though. Still dejected in whatever her pursuit regarding my character was, the young woman approached me with her gaze lowered. Then we both heard the crashing of falls.
            
            We looked to the top of the hill. I knew the young woman's smile, clear in my mind, and I dared not look at her to see it. With dread, I felt her leap and race to the top of the hill, and through her eyes, I saw the lake and the falls climbing the side of the mountain towering high into the clouds. I willed myself to follow her, aware of my resigned posture. She was already gone from my sight. I could hear her splashing about and when I reached the top of the hill, I looked down at her, fully dressed, splashing and paddling around in the waters. She laughed, though her freestyle was lacking and she could not maintain it for long.
            
            I had no initial judgments while watching her but as I descended to the side of the lake, I thought of everything I once had, the skills cultivated throughout childhood and abandoned altogether out of oblivious negligence. It was swimming and singing mainly, yet as her gaze met mine, I was aware that there was far more I did not readily acknowledge. Whether it was because of lost or inaccessible memory, or a deeply rooted indifference, it was only certain that I could not see what the more I felt was. As I stopped beside the lake, I manifested a stone and overshadowing tree to recline against. When the young woman dragged herself from the water, she flipped her mane and shook herself out like a dog, giggling all the while, but as she joined me, she pouted at the stone. She looked at me with an image of sunlight in her mind.
            
            With a roll of my eyes, I acquiesced, turning the tree and allowing sunlight to fall across the surface of the stone. Elated, the young woman peeled off her clothing and spread them out across the stone's sunlit face. She rang out her hair as she strode to my side, wearing only her underwear. Realizing she was going to plop down beside me and likely attract all kinds of dirt, I thought of a blanket. She saw the black, white and blue blanket and stopped. With a tilt of her head, she gave me a look and I saw that she wanted a beach towel that was yellow and had some kind of black and white character's face in the middle. I wondered if I had known such a towel before. Regardless, I re-imagined the blanket as a yellow towel with Mickey Mouse in the middle. She chortled and spun about, plopping down right next to me and lied down along the towel. I leaned back and stared at the light through the rustling branches.
            
            When I looked down at the young woman, she was smiling pleasantly and looked relaxed all over. How could she relax like that, I wondered, from where did her sense of undisturbable security and safety come from? Glaring at her, aware of my own spite, I imagined several strangers arriving atop the hill. The young woman stiffened beside me as the strangers filled the air with their chatter. The young woman turned to me with an open expression of fear and dread. There was no consolation I could provide and at this thought, her face hardened. It was a peculiar reaction as her voice was loud and clear in my head, demanding "Get rid of them!" The reaction was so strong and interesting that I waved my hand and erased the strangers, yet despite their disappearance, the young woman was not any less distressed. She hugged her knees to her chest, a deep frown on her face. Though I could not see it with my own eyes, I could see her eyes darting from side to side through the sense of a haze in her head.
            
            Even while I was inclined to tell her that the strangers were gone as requested, she too was contemplating telling me not to do that again, yet with the likely circumvented way of talking we would both do, there was no point in this particular conversation being enacted. I would introduce strangers to the scene again and avoid giving my direct word that I wouldn't, and telling her that the strangers are gone would only rattle her. She knew they were gone. There was no physical evidence left of their presence, neither fading voices nor shrinking figures, but she would hold herself regardless, unable to calm her body still ready for the confrontation and withdrawal of being with company.
            
            What a lonely existence.
            
            She looked up and glanced over her shoulder. With her jaw tight, she said nothing but in her head, she told me I needed to leave. I cocked my head, today's schedule coming to mind and as it often was, there was nothing of note. She gazed at me warily, and I wondered if I managed to overstay my welcome. Her gaze fell. "No," she whispered and turned away.
            
            I figured she was right and looked up. I saw the edge of a caramel wooden frame, which lengthened into the side of a square arch leading into an almost empty living area. In the dark space past the arch were two chairs set up to face one another and along the back wall was a wardrobe and bookcases. There were both books of hard and soft binding, as well as handbound books, thick binders containing self-printed copies, and journals with worn out covers. Given another square archway along the adjacent wall, a central column at the corner of the living area stood in the center of the apartment.
            
            I was sitting at a wooden table with three chairs, one of black-painted wood with a low seat and barred back, another a red metal garden chair, and the third being the sturdy dark wooden one under my rump with a red flat cushion over it, and on the far side was a stool. 
            
            On the other side of the stool was a banquet table left by the previous owner. It was made of the same dark, sturdy wood as the chair I sat on with scratches along its sides and the scribbles of a child's crayon, blue, red and faded yellow, metallic silver and an almost invisible half-circle of gold.
            
            To my right, opposite the wall with the banquet table, there stood the bed covered in a set of bed sheets, white and fur-like brown. There were two pillows lying side by side at the top of the bed and lying over them was a neatly folded, caramel-colored and scruffy-looking winter blanket. Along the same wall but in parallel with the dark living area was a kitchen. The counter ran along the wall with cabinets, fridge, stove and sink, leaving the space in front of the door open and barren. Shoes were lined up along the opposite wall near the door to the right of the square archway.
            
            There was a public bathroom on each floor with rows of shower stalls at the back of parallel rows of toilet stalls and sinks. The men's bathroom was towards the north side of the building, while the women's was towards the south side. From the door of my apartment, that meant going right to the women's and left to the men's. The elevators were around the central units towards the east side.
            
            In the area for dining and sleeping, though the living area should have been the sleeping area, there were rows of windows alongside the bed and behind the dining area was a balcony. I shifted from my chair and wandered towards the glass doors. The balcony was a metal trap, complete with black metal railings similar to a fire escape. Some people in the building would put a wooden board and maybe a rug down, then put out some furniture. Looking outside, the view was breathtaking, full of towers of blue glass, white glass, gothic arches, alternating black and red stripes, mixes of wood, concrete and steel, and so much more, but below among the streets were rows of closed shops, boarded up and painted graffiti. People without shirts or shirts on their heads pitched up their tents and scattered their rubbish over the sidewalks, which would tumble into the streets, flattened under the wheels of cars, buses and trolleys and turned to mush by rain. There were no other words I had to describe it, save for it being a city of exiles.
            
            I was aware of my stern expression, staring down the length of my nose at this city, surveying the view with critical and unforgiving eyes. I wondered if the young woman would be of the same mind but then I saw her down there, wandering in the middle of the street, stopping and looking up past the wires of old telephone lines and the lines crossing among the buildings for banners and to some people, laundry. There was no disdain in her expression. She was inclined to explore the abandoned and forgotten sites of human habitation. At the thought of seeing this city for its stark contrast between those with and those without their dignity, she grinned and set off down the street between the vehicles filling the roads.
            
            Turning back, I returned to the table and looked at the top of the stool peeking over from the other side. I remembered a therapist with a curly white mane, tawny-tinged tips, and a large scarf bundled around her neck. We agreed that my emotions were much inaccessible to me, though I found numerous ways to reiterate the point and contested the notion at times because I did access my emotions, though more often than not, I observed them through others in my head. It was, in itself and by its nature, a troubling contradiction, or conundrum as she once put it.
            
            When I told her that inside was my default mode, she asked me what that was like, so I told her that the inside world is most often at the forefront of my mind, when I am sitting without anything to do, walking from one place to another, on the bus, or even when conversations dulled and did not require my engagement with the matter. Then, there would be something at the back of my cranium checking for physical obstacles like a bicycle forgotten on the sidewalk, people sitting along the curb, the pitched tents and traces of canine excrement, as well as red lights and people shouting "God bless you" or "Fuck you" at passing pedestrians. Along the left side, it would not usually take precedence but there would be a sense of awareness looking for the next thing to grab my attention. It was always riding sidecar. While my imagination, internal landscape or mind was going, there would be that sense of awareness riding along, surveying the outside, looking for what's different than anything else, where contrast lies, where little things stand alone, and when it spotted something to see, it hit the brake and all my attention went to the external focus. I would then be set on dealing with the thing or memorizing every detail, whether it was an object or person, committing the whole scene that formed the thing's image and impression to memory, except I was no artist or user of implements like cameras, pencils or canvases.
            
            My art was words and so, for as long as I can remember, I have been obsessed with the procurement of not words but descriptions. How do I describe this person's beastly features or a face that tells an unintentional story? How do I describe the lone white dandelion, half-withered and half-dewey, in a patch of weeds at the base of an iron post? How do I describe the gesture of a young boy's wrist as he waves a stick of chalk in the air, grinning as if he might decorate the trees in this colored dust? How do I describe the sadness of the sun as it blazes past the horizon, tumbling into the blues of the ocean? What an imagination that last one was. The sadness of the sun as if it were a sentient, human-like entity.
            
            I looked back at the therapist sitting across from me, slightly leaned forward, her hands likely clasped on her lap beneath the table, and I wondered what I had to share with her today. We weren't inclined to see one another again, and remembering that, I saw a psychiatrist materialize beside me. She had such short coarse black hair, a razing would make her bald. Though she dressed in fascinating patterns, she wore a cardigan and sat upright. Then a third woman appeared at the final place at the table. She had black-rimmed spectacles and long black hair, drawing a persian-looking pashmina close about her shoulders. Willing them away, the woman with long black hair was replaced by a younger, doe-eyed woman with wavy pale blond hair, a heart-shaped face and a sympathetic gaze. The woman across from me with a white curly mane and tawny-tinged tips became a younger, lanky man in a knit sweater whose eyes hardly blinked and fixated on one's face, making any movement of his eyes far more noticeable. As for the upright woman with short black hair, there was no one to replace her, so she faded and the seat was left empty.
            
            Sitting back, letting the other two fade away as well, I thought of food in my fridge. I took my shower early in the morning as usual with my basket of toiletries standing on the edge of the kitchen counter and on a hook between the bed and kitchen hung my towel. I wasn't hungry and for a moment, I considered returning to the young woman in the forest, or wherever she was now, but checking the time, I was due for an outing. Tomorrow, my current therapist had something to try. They asked last time if they should, or if I would like them to, inform me what the method was but I figured it would be more advantageous not to. As I disliked surprises, I was inclined to prepare for myself ahead of time. I did not prepare myself, I prepared for myself, a matter discussed with one of the therapists on previous occasion and seen as possibly an obstacle to my treatment.
            
            Standing, I noted that I was running out of bottled water and checked the fridge. There were three bottles left, and I had no food. Since I did not like carrying a whole pack, and would not have it delivered, what I often did was buy eight bottles a day for three days, taking two a day and after three days, I would have a supply of twenty-four bottles, equal to twelve days more. I tried to think of a reason to venture further out than the nearby market, yet none came to mind as I grabbed my jacket, checked the pocket for my wallet and keys, and put on some shoes.
            
            As I left the apartment, I returned to the young woman in the forest, only she wasn't there anymore. She was climbing the side of the mountain with a strap over her shoulder and tied around her waist, carrying me in a covered platform, or litter, like a palanquin. It was unrealistic that she could bear such a weight, yet she struggled nevertheless and I wondered what the intent of this endeavor was. Rather than continue with the shaking ride, I floated up next to her and witnessed her give, surprised as the sudden lessening of weight. She turned her head to look at me, her face evident with strain as I cocked my head and regarded her. Turning to look up again, she continued her struggle up the vertical side of the mountain. Since she insisted on bearing my weight, I sat down on her shoulder and surveyed the view behind her. It was the same idyllic scene from earlier, only from this view could a village and the gorge beyond it be seen. I wondered where we were as I had never ventured to any landscape like it. None that I could remember anyway.
            
            Tuning in to the woman's struggle, she was bearing the weight of my burden without complaint. In her mind, there existed no alternative. She was set on the task of carrying me up the side of the mountain by her own strength. I was neither injured nor disabled, and as I rode on her shoulder, I was tempted to remind her that her task was unrealistic and unnecessarily burdensome. Hearing the thought, she would have snapped at me, except the current task took all her concentration from me as she hauled herself from one crevice to the next. Though this task was far more daunting, it reminded me of times when I would push myself in odd ways, such as the time that I forced myself to cross a street, touching toe to heel with each step, or when I army crawled across a conference room floor. It was a tendency to put myself to a task that would require patience and constant effort to complete, though I would never do any form of exercise other than walking, and sometimes the task was studying an article or rewriting a chapter from some book, whether I liked it or not. Intense, deliberate action, and I suppose that is what this young woman was doing.
            
            She stopped to catch her breath and I thought that was a fatal mistake. While inevitably she continued, to stop was to slow down and ache. Looking up, I could not believe the goal she had set for herself: to climb the mountain and bring me to the top with her. At this thought, despite her struggle, she corrected me, and I saw the top of the cliff she was aiming for. We would make it to the plateau and she would unseat my weight there. I commended her anyway. She tried not to stop, giving out a huff rather than the chuckle she felt answer me. I looked up again and the top of the cliff was nowhere in sight. I asked her if she was sure about there being an end to this endeavor. She growled at me, nothing more.
            
            As tempted as I was to fly us up to the unforeseeable cliff, I would not deprive her of a well-earned victory. Nevertheless, it was tempting and I was aware of idling away my time, waiting for a cliff to appear in the distance where none seemed to be.
            
            I could make out the street lamps and graffiti-covered walls and boarded windows outside. Though I heard the people speaking with slurred tongues, saw them staggering and bouncing with each step as if either high or pleasantly drunk, I was both walking down the sidewalks at a quick, determined pace and sitting here on the young woman's shoulder, gazing up at a false horizon. I reminded myself of the eight waters I would buy and almost strode past the store across the next crosswalk. Catching myself in time, especially at a red light, I turned the corner and steered into the store.
            
            Musing over the young woman's self-designated task, I wondered why she didn't try something more interesting like dancing. I could appreciate some festive street dancing at the moment and unlike me, the young woman was more inclined to join any sort of physical festivity. I turned the day to night and gazed down at the village below. I heard the young woman swear as she failed to catch a crevice in the dark. I would not apologize and she did not expect any.
            
            Down below, the people streamed out of their houses and apartments to lines of lanterns strewn among their rooftops. Greeting each other and passing around jugs of beer, some of the people linked hands to the ring of cymbals and rolling thump of drums, and they began their circling dances, stomping their feet and clapping their hands, spinning round and round. One girl cried out, her laughter inciting cheers and giggles around her. I heard the young woman huff beside me and glanced down at her. Her gaze was past me but she caught my glance and shook her head at me. She continued her struggle in the dark. Only then did it strike me why I should apologize, yet still she was not seeking one, so I turned my attention back to the village and enjoyed their merriful festivities.
            
            I got the eight water bottles in my arms and brought them to the cash registers at the front. As I stood in line, I materialized myself within the village, aware of the young woman still scaling the cliff face in the dark. With hands clasped behind my back, I wandered through the twisting cobbled streets of the village, musing to myself that it was like the indentation with the stones and ferns, a structure nestled among the crags and crevices of a much larger river that used to run down into the gorge. The whole village was sloping downward, though the old and new buildings were all upright. Newer streets were paved with blacktop and looking about, I figured this might be a town rather than the little village I had initially thought it to be. As I descended from one end of the twisting roads to the other, following the dip of the land and touching on newer streets with more modern aesthetics and even what looked a little downtown area at the gaping mouth to the gorge, I realized how I had missed the greater area and mistaken this town for a village.
            
            Outside, I made my way to the next available cashier and recognizing me, a young woman with bright red pigtails, she got out two small sturdy plastic bags that would carry four bottles each. She rang up the total, not bothering to tell me as I swiped my card and she slid the bottles into the bags. She stood up the pair of bags and held them out as I waited for the machine to process the transaction. As the receipt printed, I took the bags, telling her no receipt, at which she shrugged and threw the receipt away. As I headed out, I returned to the quieter streets of the downtown area in the town, where in the older parts, among the cobbled roads and strewn lanterns, people were dancing, drinking and calling out gaily. I stared out at the darkness of the gorge and the mountains beyond it, thinking of the young woman scaling the side of the mountain. Should I return to her? It was an option until I realized, passing the glass of a large department store, outside, someone was following me.
            
            I made out their figure in my peripheral but what they were eluded me as my peripheral usually conjured the oddest interpretations of visual reality. I once saw an old hunched white man as a tall black woman in a fur lined coat and a jaguar-print dress. Another time, I mistook a dark-skinned man in baggy jeans and an oversized winter coat to be an Asian old lady with a walker and reusable grocery bag on her shoulder. My peripheral could not be trusted but I knew the figure was following me and past the next intersection, I stopped in a quiet spot in front of the three pairs of doors leading to a decadent 1940s hotel lobby, one side boarded up and graffiti on the board and sidewalk reading some beautifully written cuss words.
            
            When I stopped and turned about, I came face to face with an older man, perhaps ten to fifteen years my senior, with broad shoulders and a lean build, wearing thin, black-rimmed spectacles, a neatly knit, forest and mint green winter sweater, a white and green scarf, a long black coat open wide in the front to expose his clothing and form and black slacks. He had his hands in his pockets, a plastic bag like the ones I was carrying hanging from around one of his wrists. He stared at me and I stared at him. He had a pleasant smile with eyes full of either curiosity or amusement. As I stayed where I stood on the sidewalk, he soon sauntered up to me. As he came up to me, though he did not have a big, over-imposing figure, he was tall, lean and broad-shouldered, and made a firm impression, saying "I wondered how I would get your attention." He glanced at the glass doors of the hotel lobby. "I see it's in your reflection."
            
            "Were you going to follow me the whole way back?"
            
            He regarded me and said "I was hoping I wouldn't have to. That seems too much like stalking."
            
            "You were following me," I pointed out, "I'm pretty certain about three or four streets ago, that was already considered stalking."
            
            He ducked his head but he still had that pleasant smile as he said, "Then I apologize if I have disturbed you."
            
            "Why did you follow me?"
            
            He cocked his head. "You fascinated me. I was interested in making your acquaintance." He held out his hand for a shake, about to say his name until I interrupted, turning down the gesture and telling him names weren't needed. Cocking his head again, he regarded me with open curiosity but a critical gaze. "Are you not bothered that I followed you?"
            
            I cocked my head at him. "If you're aware, perhaps I should be careful." He smirked. "What if I hadn't stopped," I wondered, "would you have followed me into my building?"
            
            "No," he said, managing a tone that was both soft and firm, "I would have waited each day and followed you until you noticed me."
            
            At such a thought, I was given two options, why he found me so fascinating and the time he would have dedicated to waiting for just a chance to meet, and chose "You don't have any other business to deal with?"
            
            He smirked and inclined his head. "Actually," he said and it sounded so matter of fact, "I am here for a conference but finding you much more fascinating than either my peers or the subject matter, I believe I'd be easily forgiven for missing it." His smirk became a grin as his gaze shifted to the lobby and then the buildings and street. "Also, I find this city rather appealing." I cocked my head at his word choice. He glanced at me, smiling. "Never have I been witness to a city so distinct in its contrast that on a single street corner one can see its opulence and deprivation all at once. Usually society would hide its lesser men and women. Here. There is no hiding whatsoever."
            
            His diction sounded like my inner monologue. That was jarring. "How would people describe you?"
            
            He grinned widely, and mused "You would rather ask how others have confided in me their perceptions than to hear of my own? That removes a natural layer of trust and validity."
            
            "It's often a person's choice, whether conscious or not, to interpret questions in such a manner that is easier for them to answer. At its heart, my question is asking who you are but whether you choose to answer from your own perspective, either in your opinion or in the collection of others', or from a third perspective, that's up to you."
            
            He nodded, lowering his gaze with a wry smile. "I would rather answer the question asked than the easier question to answer."
            
            I shrugged. "Okay. So?"
            
            He raised his gaze and stared at me. Instead of answering immediately, he continued to stare at me and I could not sense whether he was studying me or thinking past me. While I thought back to the young woman, this was a conversation that needed my attention, which was already a rare occurrence on its own but this man spoke in a manner I could relate with.
            
            When he finally spoke, it was soft and careful. "People have called me eloquent and calming. They compare me to a painting of shades of blue and gold as if I might bring them both the tranquility of color and the intensity of inspiration."
            
            I could not help gaping at him. "Has someone actually described you that way?"
            
            He grinned at me. "I have many notes on the many ways I have been described," he said and if I didn't feel the edge rising in my body, I wouldn't have noticed the hint of pride in his voice. "Would you like to hear more or perhaps read them sometime?"
            
            I blinked and it struck me what he was doing. He noticed something and his expression shifted. I frowned and he had his brows furrowed. Repeating his question to myself, remembering that he was here for a conference, I managed to ask "You brought your notes with you?"
            
            He flinched, confused for a moment, and silently processed. Realization then crossed his face as he replied, "No. It seems it's a mute point whether you can read them. You have to listen to me pontificate instead."
            
            I had never heard someone use the word pontificate in conversation before and laughed. What a grandiose manner that would entail, and it would be such an interesting form of arrogance, speaking highly of himself through the quotations of others. Looking at him, seeing the upright and cordial manner of the man in front of me, I forced myself to meet his gaze and could feel something taut in my chest, strung so tight that it was splintering, and as slow and heavy as my heart's beat, I smiled with him.
            
            "Let's meet tomorrow."
            
            I frowned. "What for?"
            
            He looked down the sidewalk and up past me. When his gaze landed on mine, he suggested we go for a cup of coffee. I told him I don't drink anything other than water but I likely wouldn't mind joining him for a more lengthy conversation. He grinned at me, asking where to meet with me. I looked over at the lobby entrance and thought of the big bold words announcing the name of the hotel along the side of the building. This was an adequate spot for him to remember. He pointed out that he had a very good memory and could have met me anywhere from the market to here as well. I shifted the bags in my hands to one and pointed up, saying this spot was good enough. He nodded. "Very well," he said, "And what time should we meet?"
            
            My appointment with the therapist was in the morning, so I asked him if the afternoon was alright. He cocked his head with a smirk, pointing out that he had no other business he would consider as pressing as the opportunity to spend more time with me.
            
            "You're so forward."
            
            He grinned. "Does that trouble you?"
            
            Taking in the way he looked at me, it was finally settled in my mind that he was studying me. While the thought had always aroused me before, the actual prospect had no singular word to describe it. If I was some form of battery, knowing that he was studying me connected me to an energy source and part of me was collecting. Perhaps this was anticipation or nervousness. What surprised me was that I could even make this observation in the moment.
            
            "No." I told him a time in the afternoon. He smiled and affirmed it. Instead of dawdling, with a bow of his head and his ever present smile, he turned about and left. I watched him go, a bit surprised at the curt action. He left so easily that watching his back, I decided I liked him, at least for now.`,
            'Jan. 12, 2021': `Dear reader, at this present moment, I must admit that my reality is not the same as yours. I am one layer removed, and yet I am affected nevertheless. The appointment for tomorrow was today and just now in your time. It was an intake to the mental health program at one of the city's most well-known hospitals and after my mechanical retelling of bloody heels, the wetness in my shoes from my blood, an empty stomach and blackening migraine, forced to a dinner where I sat at a round table full of food I could not touch, a woman at my side, constantly petting me and proud as her friends paused conversation every once in a while to admire my white skin and say how pretty I was, I find that while walking downhill under overcast skies, the dripping of branches and lampposts and a cold wind tickling my forehead and sweeping my hair from side to side, my mood is like wading above water, aware if I stop moving, I will sink and for a moment, without breath, all will be still, but that stillness is not so welcome anymore.

            The hot chocolate in my hand is not too warm and tastes more of milk than chocolate, which is perfect for me but it's disappointing. All I want at the moment is to drown, yet I'm not so desperate to seek actual substances to provide an escape. I don't want to escape. What I want is to follow the young woman down the rabbit hole, and who am I to deny myself.
            
            Finishing the hot chocolate, I have discarded the cup and made a number of turns to reach what has become my sanctum among the dingy, homeless-filled streets of this city. Instead of taking the stairs, I walk downhill a bit further and then cut across the steps, surveying the stone fixtures set up here and there on that step and along that walkway, surrounding the main steps which pause at rock sculptures acting as falls and music fills the air, classical and dramatic. This place is not the opera house, it's a prestigious concert hall within the city. I sang here in a massive choir when I was twelve.
            
            The skies have darkened and the wind blows more frequently. Apart from the music repeating over and over from my in-ear headphones, my mind is surrounded by modern broadway, classical music and the crashing waters of the rock sculpture fountains, and in this enclave of sound, I find my freedom sitting beside me. She reclines on the wet stone fixture I have seated myself on, a dry corner likely from someone else who sat here when it rained earlier. With her head thrown back and the wind rocking the strands of her hair, she smiles to herself, while chills roll across my back as the temperature drops. She opens her eyes and blinks up at the windows of the concert hall's main lobby.
            
            I do not remember the interior and perhaps I am holding onto a former glory not out of pride but out of yearning for an individual who cultivated my skill and instilled pieces of my dignity. He passed away years ago and my goodbye to him was unknowingly the last time I visited him even years more before that. I am not certain what exactly I'm yearning for but according to logic and what bits of psychology I am familiar with, I could be yearning for any of the human necessities: structure, comfort, security, familiarity, even self acknowledgement or gratification.
            
            I look at the woman beside me and decide it's time to disappear. Rising from my seat, I leave this nostalgic place. At least, I think that's what it might be. Whatever it is, I know I will be back another day. For now, let's return to my reality.`,
            'The Field and the Man': `As I return to my apartment, carrying the plastic bags, one in each hand with eight bottles of water, I follow the woman back into her world but I reach to her, wondering if she is still climbing the side of the mountain and if she would mind a change of scenery. When I find myself beside her, we stand atop the cliff overlooking the valley. She gazed at me with her triumph and then receiving my thought, she smiled. Surveying the darkened landscape, she gives a firm nod and looks once more at me. "Where," she wonders.

            The first image that came to mind was my apartment and with it, I wonder about the ruins of a grand palace, a castle of towering walls, a mansion of rooms containing whole worlds but home to a living doll, and then the beginning, a time and manner of being I have completely forgotten, but there in the fantasy of a child, I find a more traditional castle with leaning towers, drawbridges and a perpetual lightning storm raging overhead. Instead of a child leading the fray, it was a basset hound who ambled forward, ready to take on the world. My eyes tear up at the memory.
            
            The woman tilts her head, leaning over and looking at me, catching my downcast gaze and with a glance, I smile at her. "We're beyond time," I whispered. Her smile broadened. Standing upright, she looked back out at the valley and the white caps of the mountain range illuminated by the silver of the moon. She held herself to her full height, her posture proud and maybe even defiant. At that thought, she grins and glances over at me. 
            
            Ducking her head, her eyes flash with mischief and I see us jumping off the cliff. She wanted us to fly. My whole being froze and my gut tightened. I could not fathom flying and at the imagining of it, I felt sheer dread. As a child, I relished flight but in recent years, all dreams of flying have always been stilted or worse, I would plummet into the waking world. I could already feel the needles of the cold air against my cheeks, the billowing of the wind in my ears. It was frightening that I knew flight and I knew how I yearned for it, feeling the absence of wings along my back, sawed down and ripped out in previous dreams. The absence was so sound that from deep in my belly, I revolted.
            
            The woman latched onto my arms, gazing into my eyes and shaking her head. With her protest, the moon grew brighter and the air around us colder. Chills ran down my back, one after the other and I trembled deep in my bones. I begged her and her pleading smile became distressed. She collected my hands in hers and kissed my chilled knuckles. Her warmth was baffling. She rubbed my knuckles against her cheek and as I looked into her moonlit eyes, I could feel the tears of terror I could not shed. She took a deep breath and sighed. Looking down, she loosened her hold on my hands and turned to the valley, only a moment before looking back down. Taking another deep breath, she looked at me and mustered a smile. Between our minds, she said okay, but the word from her mouth was "Go."
            
            Despite her given resignation, I hurried to think of some other destination for us and I could not help remembering the field of rolling hills and green grass so tall that young children disappeared beneath. Why I returned to that place so often through the years, I could not apprehend but taking the woman's hand, I led her into the grass. As a child, it was my height then, so as an adult, the grass had been about waist height. This time though, it was taller than our heads and it allowed such a feeling of privacy. I was filled with both wonder and dread, a squeeze to my hand pulling me out of the mire in my chest. I looked at the young woman with her reddish mane. She had no doubts, no worries and to realize that that is what these were, I lowered my head. Though I knew full well why I did not indulge these feelings, let alone acknowledge or express them, I wondered why I could not see them for what they were before.
            
            I stole a glance at the young woman and she looked at me unimpressed. With a smile, I pulled her after me. She pushed forward, so that we walked side by side, the blades bending under and around us as we made our way forth. There was nothing to be seen ahead of us, nothing but the stalks of grass and above us was the bluest sky, serene as white clouds rolled and shifted in passing. The air here was both warm and cool, and I stopped, eyes wide when I realized that I was barefoot and beneath my feet, between my toes, I felt the moist soils mold to the curves of my soles.
            
            Beside me, the woman laughed out loud. Gripping my hand and grinning as wide as she could, she twisted, burying her feet in the soil. She shook her head and peeked at me. I think what I was feeling was mortified. Gripping my hand even tighter, she began moving, dancing and purposely digging her feet into the moist soil. She laughed and laughed, her grin never faltering, her eyes soon urging me to join her. The only coherent thought I managed was a firm no and leaned back, eyes on her hand, willing it to let go, but I knew deep down I could not stop her nor deny her this exuberant joy. She let go on her own though and then stomped around among the blades. She danced and kicked up the dirt, soon her movements shifting from abrupt and crass to gentle and fluid. She allowed the blades to guide her, whispering with the breeze and fluttering with her hair. How peaceful she looked and remembering earlier, I wondered how the hell she achieved it so easily. The freedom of her character seemed an obvious indicator, but I could not fathom how that was it. Was the full liberation of character the only way to feel so open and relaxed as she did?
            
            Feeling the tingle of where her hand had touched and held mine, I gazed above the grass to the skies. I felt rightly small and insignificant but that thought did not land as I found the majesty of the skies too overpowering. I resigned myself to that majesty of blue and white, yet I felt my frown and wondered of the humbled defeat I was facing. When I looked over, the young woman was back to her initial childish antics but noticing my gaze, she froze, grinned and ducked into the grass. She dived far enough away that she disappeared from sight. I could feel her circling and then she giggled, letting the sound carry around in the air after her.
            
            I stepped forward, feeling the mush of the ground squish beneath my feet. Taking a steadying breath, I continued forward and all around me, I heard the rustling of the blades as the woman danced, pranced and twirled, following after me in arcs and circling me. There was no place to go. The grass was so tall that nothing but the sky and the immediate ground could be seen. I had no idea of any horizon in any direction. For some reason, as ridiculous as it seemed to me, this felt like my struggle.
            
            Just as the woman climbed the side of the mountain with my weight as her burden, I was walking through this sea of grass, each step shaking me up from deep in my gut. Of course there could be no comparison and as I walked, I thought of the man who'd followed me. Reviewing what he said, I was stopped, finding the young woman suddenly in front of me, hands thrown out, mute, and eyes wide. She held my gaze and nodded at me, giving her permission to do this sort of thing again. I clenched my hand. It's been such a long time, but it was appropriate after all. If I was going to acclimate myself to people again, perhaps I should relearn this old skill. Standing upright, I held out my hand to the woman. She met my gaze with wide eyes and smiled with evident hope. Straightening up, she took my hand and we closed our eyes.
            
            At the sound of car horns and the smell of flattened, decomposing rubbish, we opened our eyes and found ourselves on the sidewalk in front of the decadent 1940s hotel lobby where the man and I had spoken. The woman looked around me eagerly. She shoved her hands in her pockets as she looked all around, taking in this whole scene. I wondered if she had seen this city before. Though I imagined her earlier on the street, that was an answer to my thoughts, not so much a view of her in action. Now, she was taking in all the gritty, grimy details of this space with a childlike wonder. While I wanted to think it was disproportionate, for her, I knew there was no such thing as restraint. She was really in awe of this place.
            
            Looking down the sidewalk, I saw the man. He was a reconstruction, so the flaws and complexities in his appearance were airbrushed away. Spotting the man, the young woman leapt up with a giggle and ran over to compare her height with his. She circled him and inspected the plastic bag hanging off his left wrist. With his hands in his pockets, he was motionless and staring at me. I tried to recall the beginning of our conversation. He said something about me looking at him. "I see it's in your reflection."
            
            I looked up and found him standing in front of me. Trying to recall details of the conversation, I was only certain of that first line and that we would be meeting each other tomorrow in the afternoon, same spot. I glanced up and the young woman was hanging over his shoulder, grinning at me. She was draped over his shoulder like a child on a slide. When I looked at her, she giggled. I shook my head. She hopped off and rounded him back to my side. Setting her hands on her hips, she looked between him and me. She gave me an expectant look.
            
            I tried again to remember our conversation. The reconstruction started moving, enacting the bits and pieces I could recall like his lack of business, the words opulence and deprivation. "I find this city rather appealing." He had a good memory, saying that I could have chosen anywhere from the market to "here." Usually, "cities try to hide lesser men and women. Here." There is no hiding, I wasn't certain he said that. Rubbing at my forehead, I stole a glance at the reconstruction and at my side, the woman studied him with an intense gaze. I recalled settling on the thought that he was studying me. The woman looked up and the reconstruction turned his head and gazed at her, smiling pleasantly. I realized his expression hardly changed. His manner was so certain and relaxed. Did he say "I'm sorry that I disturbed you?"
            
            He was wearing forest and mint green. I looked him over and noted that he'd been wearing a scarf, which looked murky white. It was either white and blue or white and green. He wore a dark long coat and dark slacks. Both the woman and I were drawn to his wrist as he pulled his hand out of his pocket to offer a handshake, and there on his wrist was a platinum and gold wristwatch. The woman whistled. I frowned, my forehead aching, and I could not remember for certain if I had seen a wristwatch or not. The accessory was so clear, it had to be an addition of my own unconscious imaginings. I realized that the woman had whistled. Looking at her, I was upset that she could do something I have never been able to. She heard my thoughts and laughed, devolving into giggles, hugging her shaking middle.
            
            Waiting for her to desist, I looked over the man and as I took in the scruff along his broad jaw, his clear bright eyes behind thin black-rimmed spectacles and the rosy hue of his elevated cheekbones, I felt a coil of warmth in my belly and looked at the woman who looked back at me at the same time, biting her lips together to subdue a smile, yet with shaking shoulders and the huffs of laughter, she spun away, slapping me on the face with her hair, and she squealed, laughing. "He's so cute," she gushed and screamed, flapping her hands in the air. I stepped away from her and the reconstruction, but as mindless and ecstatic as she seemed, she followed my step, wrapped her arms around me and pulled me tight to her, still squealing and rubbing her cheek against mine once she found it.
            
            Indulging in her madness, I studied the man's reconstruction and it occurred to me that someone in my life, or family, might instantly disapprove. With her fast instincts, I wondered if I should reconsider the meeting tomorrow. Telling myself what happened, feeling the woman sag against me with a sigh, I reviewed the course of action again from the moment he first appeared in my field of vision, the kind of words he was saying and the tone of his voice, to confirming when and where we would meet tomorrow and how he left.
            
            "We don't have to go."
            
            I looked down at the woman bent at the hip, arms still wrapped around me, her cheek against my side. She peered up at me. "It's preferable that we don't," I said.
            
            She shrugged, keeping her arms around me. "He caught our attention."
            
            Other people have stopped and throughout my life, they have told me I'm cute, my hair is beautiful, or that they noticed me because I just stood out. In this sense, he was no different but his approach was incomparable. He waited for me to notice him. Rather than approaching me and politely interrupting my stride or calling out to me from some distance, he followed behind me, silent and watching, and when I noticed him and stopped, I stared at him as he stared at me. Then he came up to me, slow and intentional. He'd been holding my attention with each step and relished it, and when he stopped in front of me, his words were that he was waiting for me to see or notice him. "I see it's in your reflection." I felt a squeeze around me. When I looked down, the woman was pouting and looked up at me, her eyes full of concern.
            
            Trying to sort out what I thought about this, there was as usual nothing. Instead, it was a sensation of a spider crawling across my belly and stopping on my sternum. "Do we trust him?"
            
            The woman pulled back giggling. I understood it instantly and smiled at her. She covered her smile with the back of her hand, but looking at me, she could not hide it. Thinking back, I pondered over this odd man. In a way, he was like the woman next to me, separate from the natural order of public decency and expectations of civilized or appropriate behavior. When I looked at the woman, she was again bent at the hip, fluttering her eyelashes as she glanced up at me, wriggling her butt like a dog with a wagging tail. She grinned. She was proving it. As I looked away from her, she broke out in a fit of giggles and spun away, hugging her middle. Thinking back to the man, hearing my own question again, I wondered "Why him?"
            
            Outside in the greater reality, dear reader, there was no one. We were a lonely trio, this parody of me, myself and I. This man who I could not believe aroused actual arousal in me at his appearance was most likely my own gift to myself. He served a purpose here, if only to make me confused and condemn the young woman at my side to another fit of riotous giggles. I thought of the appointment tomorrow with the therapist. If I dismissed it, this world of mine would be no different from the young woman's, subject to our whims and whimsy, though whimsy was mainly the young woman's device, so it seemed.
            
            When I looked at her with her gleaming eyes and mischievous smile, she urged me to do it. Dismiss the appointment. I frowned at her, trying to remember which reality we were in at the moment. We were in a field before this, so essentially we were in her world, not mine or the greater one beyond it, though provided the reconstruction, this place looked a lot like mine. If I waved my hand here and thought of no more appointment, would it be erased from my reality? This was not how it worked for the greater reality you, dear readers, resided in, so would it work for mine?
            
            The woman smiled, hands in her back pockets as she leaned away from me, watching me. I could not discern what she was thinking, her mind closed off to my inquiry. With a smile, her tongue touching her teeth, she continued openly denying me access to whatever thoughts she was happily indulging in her head. Thinking about the man, it occurred to me then that my gift to myself was probably a psychopath. The woman squealed and was taken by another fit of boisterous giggles. At least one of us was laughing. Listening to the sound, I allowed myself a small smile but nothing more.
            
            Thinking of my greater self out there who was essentially no more than me, though the same couldn't be said of this woman at my side and whatever manner of internal being she was to me was so questionable, I accepted the prospect of meeting the man tomorrow. As for the appointment with the therapist, with a glance at the still giggling woman, I snapped my fingers and without a doubt, both here in the reconstruction and in my reality, the whole circumstance of having a therapist to see was gone. I was barreled into by the still giggling woman who clung to me, even daring to wrap one of her legs around me and in her arms, given the force of her impact, I was left to lean to one side as she rested most of her weight on me, ceaseless in her vocal gaiety.
            
            In my reality, I was in my apartment, seated at the chair and had been sitting for a decent while, indulging in my time with the woman. My phone was in my hands and reviewing my subconsciously driven memory of the last half hour or so, the appointment with the therapist had been canceled on my phone. The appointment with the man was given a reminder in my task list. Going through the app for my medical records and doctor appointments, there was a notice to reschedule the cancellation. I debated whether or not to do it. Reason told me I should, since I was not one to miss appointments or halt treatments, especially when involving mental health. It was a wonder why I even bothered with a doctor or therapy, when I already had it as part of my weekly schedule in the greater reality.
            
            I contemplated if the man was a fateful encounter. Provided the woman's reaction, I could not help feeling that he was, so whether I realized it there or here, I felt I had to resign myself to his interventions. Like the woman, I had to wonder who he was. By now, if it wasn't already clear to you, dear reader, it's at least too clear to me and the understanding it brings gives me yet more dread as I wonder in what manner the woman will continue to reflect my mental, emotional or physical state. What does she actually represent, or embody?
            
            I could not help but to join my greater self as she was writing. You are readers after all, so somehow this had to be written and here I sit on the makeshift bed she has made across a couple chairs out of a row of three. I sat, arms folded and one leg crossed over the other, looking down at the bowed head of my greater self as she continued to type my consciousness into being. I'm here, so that she can fulfill her need to sort out what will happen next. This is easier for her than, I suppose, sitting in a chair in some corner, getting lost in her mind and potentially, by the shift of her expressions and sudden erratic gestures, such as swaying, throwing out her hands or covering her mouth, looking crazy. So now here we are for conference with one another. What is my fate to entail?
            
            She paused her fingers and contemplated my question. We have the man to think about and the role he will play. Before she can go any further, I would like to ask that this not be some kind of romantic fiction. Neither of us is in any position to be pursuing intimacy or affection. I would like to remind her of earlier today for it is still the same day in greater reality. Need I recite the list of traumas we related to the social worker for intake to the mental health program?
            
            She reminds me that I do not, she is well aware and there is the pressure and wetness of potential tears as she recalls it. How odd it must be, perhaps, that you see how we see ourselves? I am a consciousness separate from myself and yet, there is no other me. Then I have a mind of my own and in there lies a woman of similar countenance to me. If you don't find this narrative structure odd, then at least for your sake, I do, and here, we are aware of our sadness, the loneliness in being this way. I bow my head and regard my greater self as she realizes for the umpteenth time the nature and depth of her loneliness in your reality.
            
            Perhaps I should concede to the romance with an apparent psychopath. There will always be another one to draw our attention away, but the important question is, Can this give us what we need to be better? Well, okay, better, she struggled for that word, for there is no exact word to encompass our present goal. The therapists she has met, or that I have met should I assume my rightful being, have all used the word better, as in to get or become better. It sounds like self-improvement and perhaps that is what mental health is all about anyway, regardless of disease and disorder.
            
            This is the way we think and we have struggled to convey this to others. I see from no singular perspective, even if I am but one being as a whole. Whether it is I or me, even the she I have observed and interacted with this last day or so, how does this fracturing of I into we happen? Is it justified?
            
            This is too many questions, not for me or her but in our perception of you, dear readers. You're not here for our questions. While we cannot fathom why you're here and have so remained after all, I am of little doubt that you didn't come to me for my questions. Now then, I look at my greater self and urge her to focus on the task she wanted to complete. She has brought a man into my reality, remember the psychopath I met on my way back to my apartment, and most likely, we are heterosexual though my attention is often taken by women. Come to think of it, the woman's attention is just as often taken by men, and this greater self of ours, her attention is not taken by anyone but by beauty and extraordinary faces and features and outstanding things. What is our actual sexuality? I am compelled to wonder.
            
            She is smiling, my greater self is. She is fine with this, but I must remind her that we still have yet to address the man. What is desired is of no secret between us. Perhaps we are heterosexual after all, or maybe we are demisexual. I regard my greater self for that thought resonated with her. To build a relationship. Seeing her contemplations, I worry, we worry that we are wrapping ourselves in an elaborate delusion, that we are only forming an attractive foil to continue with our circumvential denials of reality and ourselves. The therapy is supposed to help us, though what help we need still eludes us. Is there genuinely something wrong with us, or is it that we want something to be wrong with us, so that we might justify our inner surrender to life's ebb and flow, to give up on the greater reality.
            
            Listen to what I think, so I implore her and I lean towards my greater self. Though I think of taking her hands in mine just as the woman had done, I clasp my hands together, but I sit close and I want her to know, if nothing else, may she know this.
            
            I am here for us and we have denied our feelings, we have trained ourselves to disconnect with the greater world, and having attempted time and again to destroy what our imaginations have so painstakingly built, minute by minute, hour by hour and day by day for years of our childhood, perhaps it is time that we listen to the optimism and insights of the outsiders. It was such words that compelled me to my experiment after all.
            
            We have tried to live in the greater world and deaden, if not contain and subdue ourselves and our inner worlds to the extent of living by the will of our unconscious, while fighting back and neglecting ourselves with all that we have in our mental faculties, and it has ruined us. I have said before, over and over, that I am tired of my reality, from long in the past to all its likely potential in the future. Nightly hallucinations and visits from ghastly humanoid creatures, lying under the bodies of men and being fed, petted and controlled by women, homeless, starved, living in the ghetto in a foreign country, food shortages and lessening funds during the outbreak of a pandemic throwing a whole nation into lockdown, my father's corpse, the paralysis of pain and the monsters and surreal sights I was made witness to, the terror of touch and physical inspection, acclimating myself to sleeping on kitchen and bathroom floors in an attempt to escape the intimacy of one's bed, dumping myself in an ice box or sleeping outside in winter, my list is still longer and it is ever lengthening. Happiness and hope are not part of our design, and yet how freely our innermost self laughed. Her constant wonder and awe of even the most depressing and disdainful place I have seen yet would give anyone hope for us.
            
            That is something I have only realized now. The eccentric, wholesome self I have so diligently contained and controlled, burying her in our innermost world, and looking out that should she surface, she does no harm or damage and recedes as quickly as she arose, is the glimpses of our humanity that has so endeared others to us. She is acceptable, perhaps to most everyone else other than us. Of course to an extent as she is as forceful with her disdain and terrors as she is with her joy and pleasure.
            
            I regard my greater self and query whether she has listened to me or not. But even with all this out in the open, the question for us is, How do we move forward? I would venture to say that my greater self is banking on the man in my reality to guide and assist us through. He is born out of her yearning for a companion as wholesome and perhaps not eccentric but certainly would have the potential to entwine with my reality. Is that what is to happen here?
            
            Such a thing cannot be fathomed, can it?
            
            I look at my greater self and though I am tempted to rest my hand over her bowed head, I do not. I would rather leave her be as the night grows late and we are due for some rest. Tomorrow will be another day for our wandering in and out, or between, our realities. I will meet the man tomorrow and we will see how things go from there. I have stood, poised behind her row of chairs for a makeshift bed, one hand on the back of a chair, and again, I catch myself looking at her, continuing to type me into being. At the words that I will leave her alone now, the pressure of tears arises in her eyes. How fragile my greater self is. Though this has already been established, it is still hard for some to believe, perhaps myself most of all. There are no words I can give now to comfort her for with awareness of me, she is frightened of how deluded we might be.
            
            It is time to prepare for bed and sleep. She cannot seem to let me go and so continues to type on her cell phone, forcing me to stay here with her. How reminiscent of childhood this is. I now realize that I was the pen in her hand and the pages of her notebook, where she would scrawl the word "sleep" over and over until she passed out, her face pressed to my pages. As a secondary sense of self, it seems I can even assume, or endow inanimate objects with consciousness. I really don't want to explore that notion, and I truly hope that my greater self, or even the woman, do not ever find the heart and mind to play with me in such a manner. My greater self smiles. Put down the phone and let one rest for the night.
            
            Good night.`,
            'The Garden': `I watched as the woman re-enacted the happenings of last night. In a reconstruction of a homeless shelter's day room with a row of stacked pairs of lockers against one wall, doors to a woman's bathroom on either side and a door to the shower room at the far end adjacent to the door to a laundry room, empty with all the machines stacked and collected towards the back of the day room, and opposite the wall of lockers is a wall with two doors to women's dorms, one for elderly women in raised beds with partitions to separate them and the other filled with bunk beds, covered in sheets and surrounded by luggage, tubs and plastic bags full of snacks and amenities, and beside one of the doors is the pile of mats for those sleeping on the floor. Opposite the collection of laundry machinery is a pony wall leading into a fireplace with a tv and dvd player on the mantle. At the edge of the tv viewing area, three chairs are set side by side in preparation of a makeshift bed and it's in standing from the center chair that the woman laughs and laughs as she wobbles and staggers, her body lowering with each step, but she pushes up, still laughing and whining, making her way around the makeshift bed and then the laundry machinery to a heater and socket, where a backpack sits with a wire coming out, attached to the socket. The woman hardly makes it halfway there before rounding about and collapsing. She pushes up to her feet and manages a few steps before falling back on her bottom, legs bent at odd angles as she laughs and laughs.

            With a huff, I look away. Though I would like to move on from this re-enactment, both the woman and my greater self are intent on remembering this very public display of sensation that no one took offense with or scolded us for. Instead, an older, heavy set, dark-skinned woman who has been complaining frequently about the smell of urine and exploring ways to dispel the smell swoons over the fragrant oil she has placed on top of the machinery. It has a strong citrus scent and she croons first, exalting the smell, and then saying how she loves it coming back and forth, and the woman laughs. She does not point out that she and the older woman are talking about two different things, yet they are both enjoying themselves. Instead, she skips this part of the re-enactment and keeps laughing.
            
            I am seated on a chair against a column perpendicular to the row of chairs and watch as the woman flounders, happily continuing with the re-enactment. There is no business that I know of in my reality and in the greater reality, my greater self is idling her time away through me and the woman, while waiting for her first appointment with a new therapist. When I look at the woman floundering on the floor, driven to laughter through the tingling along the back of her thighs, hence all her wobbling and staggering about, I can see why we would relish this moment. In therapy, it has been affirmed that we do not allow our eccentric self to appear, yet re-enacting last night in the greater reality, the woman and my greater self agree that it may not be so bad, but I am skeptical. I have not forgotten my words to my greater self from my yesterday. It is not easy to accept change or even acceptance after its long absence.
            
            I stand and approach the fumbling woman. Her laughter died off. She takes a breath and looks at me with a lazy smile. I stare down at her, then offer her my hand. She takes another breath, studying my hand and knowing that if she takes it, the time for re-enactment will be at an end. However, how accurate the re-enactment is questionable as my memory, and so that of my greater self, has been fuzzy and full of gaps recently, not that it wasn't before. I have always had memory problems, always in the present, and this I say as a whole.
            
            The woman releases a sigh and with a quirk of her lips, she takes my hand. I help her up and once she is standing, we look about at the room. Looking at each other, we nod to one another and head out.
            
            Stepping out the front door, I bring us to my reality. One look around though and my nose wrinkles. Beside me, the woman giggles. When I look at her, she cocks her head to the side, eyes wide and gleaming, and a smile across her lips. Given that she is with me, I am tempted to resurrect old structures and reconstruct many recent memories for processing but perhaps, it is as it should be to follow her to that little town nestled in the valley. There is no direction for me as I walk about, navigating the sodden filth-ridden sidewalks, avoiding the homeless men and women both loitering and milling about. At the same time, I find myself strolling along cobbled streets in the early morning, the woman beside me, admiring the houses and shops we pass. The eaves of the buildings catch my attention with their flourishes and curved tiles. Hearing the woman huff, I look at her and find her smiling. She too found interest in the eaves.
            
            The word reminds me of a song my greater self once sang. To whom she was singing is debatable but the most memorable line of the song was "Oh look, do you people see, a boy, a boy hangs by the eaves." At the time, the visions that accompanied the haunting song were vague. Now, as I consider them, the meaning strikes me and the image is vivid. I glanced at the woman whose expression has become sullen, her eyes comprehending an image of horror. We both find ourselves looking up to the eaves of the buildings, searching for the hooks and a noose, but these buildings with withered walls and low roofs do not fit with the image we fear realizing. We continue on downward. The woman squeezes her fingers, worrying them, as we walk, and recognizing her distress, I acknowledge that if I have any, perhaps she is the depiction. She looks at me and I wonder if perhaps we should venture elsewhere. In answer, her gaze is drawn out of the town towards the gorge and mountains.
            
            With the faint glow of the early morning, the gorge resembles a bed of jagged and jutting rocks. I would imagine a massive dragon would find it comfortable to amass treasures between the rocks and form a nest. Beside me, the woman mused that there just might be a dragon hidden there within the deeper parts of the gorge. I look at her, concerned that such a thought might bring such a creature into being. The woman looks at me and wriggles her eyebrows with suggestion, so I ask of the dangers in meeting a live dragon. The woman throws back her head and chortles, clutching her belly with a grin exposing the rows of her teeth. She points out that this world is safer than mine and the greater reality we defer to. "Here," she whispers with conspiracy and mischief in her smile, "There be dragons to ride and talk with." Straightening up, her hair swishing around her, she added "And maybe a tea party of hell fire and brimstone crumpets."
            
            I cocked my head and regarded her, not knowing what a crumpet was. She looked at me and huffed. "It's a crumpet," she cried and I was still at a loss. We weren't English by birth but by heritage. She sighed and threw a hand over her eyes. Releasing another sigh, she dropped her hand and looked at me. With a shake of her head, she grabbed my hand and we set off down the rest of the main street, which transitioned from cobbled to paved, and the woman marched ahead, never letting go of my hand.
            
            We were going to meet a dragon, so the image in her mind told me. I thought back to a boy being hung from the eaves of a house and the woman stopped, whirled on me and gave me a look, wondering why I would fixate on something so disturbing. In answer, I thought of a dragon pulling back its head and letting out a stream of fire and roasting us alive, wondering if that was more appropriate. The woman huffed, torn between a laugh and a whine, wondering why I was being so difficult. I wasn't being difficult, I told her, just scared. She laughed, her distress gone and regarded me warmly. We stared at each other, considering whether to continue on or not. If we were actually going to meet a dragon, I was against it. The woman, on the other hand, lowered her gaze and thought about it.
            
            What she was thinking, I could not access. The thoughts she was considering were hers alone, which reminded me of how I introduced her to you, dear readers, initially. I told you that what capacity she had for thought or reflection was nothing more than what was shared with me. I cannot remember if these were my exact words or even the same essential concept, but in essence, she was supposed to be completely accessible to me in her thoughts and feelings. Perhaps I should avoid introducing things with my initial concepts or parameters.
            
            The woman looked at me with a tilt of her head, then she took my hand and led me down an adjacent side street. By the paved road, we were still in the newer part of the town but unlike the main road which sloped downward from one end of the town to the other, this road was flat for a stretch then rose, climbing along the side of the jagged indentation down a very tall hill that the town was nestled into. We passed several intersections, one side of the road being carved into the hillside with houses and shops digging into the rocks. We reached a steep incline and continued our trek towards what I guessed was the northside of the town, the left urban area from the mouth of the gorge, mounting the side of the hill. Once the ground leveled out, I looked back and saw part of the expanse of the town hidden by the hill. We were only halfway up towards the initial part of the town I had seen, assuming it was a village, and from this point, in the faint glow of early morning, I saw the tiers of the town and its numerous winding side streets breaking off from the main street like veins on a leaf, the tiled rooftops and even rooftop gardens on newer buildings, vines, trellises and the dimly lit lamp posts along the paved roads. This too seemed too idyllic for me.
            
            Looking back, I found the woman half through the open doorway of a nearby house, scanning the interior. I walked up to her side. She made room for me to have a look around as well. It seemed to be a flower shop with many shelves covered in potted plants, vines, ferns and even small trees. With a glance at me, the woman strode in. She gestured for me to follow. As I stepped in behind her, she gestured for me to close the door. She stepped lightly, most of her weight on the balls of her feet as she waded through the plant life filling the room. From the windows, dim beams of light streaked her figure and caught on her reddish mane, giving her a faint golden glow. She looked back at me and grinned. With a wide gesture to follow her, she continued forward and just one step later, disappeared into the darkness like it had eaten her up.
            
            While I could feel my surprise, I followed her, not bothering to humor caution or practicality, and I too was consumed by the darkness. I could not see her or anything around me, yet I heard her soft steps ahead of me. I wondered where we were heading and was answered with the vision of a sunlit garden bursting with color. It was still early in the morning. The sun was due to rise but no one was awake. I could see her unimpressed look in my head, even though I could not see her, and as she continued forward, I did as well.
            
            I felt my shoes dissolve and my bare feet touched cool wood. Following after her footsteps, I smelt the dew and grass before touching moist earth and paused. I urged her to make a sound as I could no longer hear her footsteps. A giggle was fine but she resisted and remained silent. I held out my hands and felt the tips of tall grass, feeling the length of their stalks and brushing against the grooved bark of a nearby tree. I remembered the image the woman sent to me of a garden and wondering if we might already be here, I ventured forward, feeling the ground, making out the grass and then perhaps a dirt path and patches of moss, or grass, and other weeds.
            
            I heard her huff. It came from off to the right in front of me. I ventured three more steps forward before my hand brushed against the back of hers. She wrapped her hand around mine and gave me a squeeze. In my mind, she urged me to open my eyes. I told her my eyes were open. I could see her smile, yet I still could not see her. She gave another squeeze to my hand and urged me to relax. Now that's impossible, I told her, I don't relax. She giggled lazily and urged me again. I held still and focused on breathing.
            
            It was mortifying and beside me, she laughed, bent over at the waist and clutching her belly. I snapped at her and suddenly, met with her beaming smile, I was blinded by the onset of light. I blinked away all the dark spots, finding splotches of color and felt the tickle of a breeze along my nape. When I looked out, we were in a garden teeming with life. There was every kind of tree, shrub and flower imaginable, even those I had yet to see in person. Among the trees, shrubs and flowers, all kinds of creatures were collected, watching us from where they perched. There was even a leopard lying among the branches of the nearest tree, staring at me from among the leaves. It cocked its head and purred, leaning forward to look at me.
            
            I thought about how we got here and wondered if this was still a flower shop. The woman threw back her head and chortled behind her hand, squeezing mine with the other. I looked around and with my limited knowledge of flowers, erroneously guessed at the large variety surrounding us. I couldn't tell the difference between a tulip, lily and orchid or a rose and magnolia but regardless, no doubt every kind was here, including those with only names in other languages. There was even a bonsai tree and to the woman's right, the grass gave way to sand and pebbles. With a squeeze to my hand, the woman hopped, pulling me with her, and I staggered to follow as she led me over the sand and urged me to climb the bonsai tree with her.
            
            I had always thought of bonsai trees as small, easily maintained fauna, but this one was big and imposing like a banyan tree, rising like another mountain. With its twisting and knotted trunk, it was easy for us to climb and at the second knot, I caught my breath, closing my eyes and I felt I might cry. When I opened my eyes, the woman was poised above me like a macaque monkey, practically upside down along the trunk of the bonsai, looking at me. "It's been so long since I've climbed a tree."
            
            She laughed and smiled. Turning around, she smiled back at me and urged me to keep going. She resumed climbing and I followed after her, winding round the trunk of the bonsai, finding footing among grooves and knots. We stopped on a large branch, wide enough to walk along without too much fear of falling. The woman stood and walked across. She settled down and waved for me to join her. I looked down. Heights had never scared me as a child and I found even now, the height did not bother me. While I was aware of the fall, the branch was sturdy and three times wider, perhaps more so, than a balance beam. I strode across, crouched down with my hands along the branch and seated myself beside the woman. She grinned at me, then we looked out at the garden she'd brought me to. It was much more of a forest of everything than a garden and it went on and on in all directions.
            
            As we looked out over the forest, I was surprised to realize that nothing in my reality had grabbed my attention up to now. Usually, there would be something here or there like the woman I saw poised on a skateboard at an intersection. She had ratty braids, and wore netted tights and short shorts, a jacket of recycled materials, a netted backpack and fingerless gloves. A dog's leash was tied to the backpack and as she balanced on the skateboard, a man was cleaning the zipper and lining of her backpack. My description is likely wrong as I was not provided a chance to study her. The man had been facing the view from her back and she had been facing forward. I could not have studied her without stopping to her side and that would have been too obvious as they weren't going anywhere.
            
            There was another time, just today in the greater reality, when I was back at the concert hall sitting on one of the stone sculptures. A thin, dark-skinned man with a face mask came up to me, offering me money. He was holding a twenty, some fives and ones. His eyes were narrowed into slits as he spoke and while initially tempted to just accept the offered money, I asked him why. He said money is not important. I asked him why he would give it to me and he said because he loved me. I told him to keep it and reward himself with food. He seemed genuinely pleased as he said thank you and strode away.
            
            I looked at the woman. She had a pleasant, if not peaceful, smile and her gaze wandered to mine. The corners of her lips turned up as she looked at me. I figured it was time to end my walk. The woman cocked her head, wondering if I was hungry. I realized I had no lunch. Checking the time in my reality, I realized I was shivering and laughed, finding that I had been walking around outside for hours. I had an hour left before I would meet the man. The woman perked up beside me and nudged my arm. I looked at her, wondering why she did that. She rolled her eyes. Yesterday, I noted that I was drawn to women and she was drawn to men. As I recalled this thought, the woman's brows knitted together. She looked up in thought.
            
            It wouldn't be so odd in the greater reality as it would make me lesbian and her straight but we were at levels within a greater consciousness. It was only somewhat clear to me how we were related. I wondered if we really had a sexuality, since we generally despised and feared people's company and our greater self had never been attracted to anyone she met or saw. I felt a bit of arousal yesterday while looking at the man's reconstruction, so maybe my leaning was straight, though I generally found men's bodies repulsive. When I looked at the woman beside me and what she was thinking, she loved and preferred men's bodies through and through.
            
            I told her that we should switch places and she could meet with the man instead. The woman perked up at that and looked at me with deepening interest. Could we actually switch places? The thought was horrifying. She slumped down with a sigh. Looking at me, she fluttered her lashes at me. I didn't even know if it was possible to switch places but as I thought about it, she could break out into the greater reality beyond my control, what stopped her from breaking out into mine? She smirked at me, urging me to consider, then pushed me off the branch.`,
            'Escaping a Crowd': `I jerked and caught myself from stepping off the curb during a red light. Checking the street signs for my crossroads, I did not immediately recognize the name but seeing the numbers beside the names, I knew at least one of the next streets, looking about to determine in which direction that would be. Stepping back, I turned and hurried down the sidewalk past tents and some young people loitering, sitting on the pavement and talking about boards, sandwiches and stock of leaves. Though I noticed the fenced-in park, where murals and graffiti were painted over every bench and stone covering, I mapped the streets in my head, looking at potential turns and routes back to my apartment. As I tried to navigate my way back and estimate the time there, I stopped when it struck me how little time I would have. My stomach clenched. Readjusting the map in my head, I saw the way ahead and did not move.

            If I met with this man, would anything change for me?
            
            What if he was, I could not assume and yet, I had. I called him a psychopath, which is no problem, if I were to meet him as I can easily compartmentalize my memory and act as if nothing has ever crossed me. I went in and found the woman in the forest garden. She stopped and looked at me with a smile. I stared at her but this was not what anyone thought it was. Looking behind myself, I found the entrance we came through. It was just as dark as it was coming in, framed by tall grass, low-hanging tree branches and ferns, and on the ground was our footprints.
            
            Turning back to the woman, I held out my hand to her. She looked at my hand and slowly advanced. Though we held hands a number of times before this, when she touched my hand, she urged me to feel hers, to become aware of the feel of our skin, our fingers, and a bolt of electricity shot up my arm. I resisted the urge to pull back, letting her hand settle over mine. She cocked her head at me, wondering what it was like. Not wanting to answer, I turned and led her back into the darkness.
            
            This time, I would not waste my time. We passed through the darkness and the woman stumbled after me. I could see her astonishment and confusion but did not look at her as we entered the flower shop. To my surprise, we found ourselves surrounded by people who all stopped and stared back at us. Beside me, the woman huffed. She was shocked and torn between crying, running back in, and laughing at our sudden predicament. I did not anticipate this, let alone predetermine this, so I was as stunned and lost for what to do as the number of strangers now staring at us likely were as well. 
            
            Squeezing the woman's hand, I stepped forward and with each step, I met every pair of the strangers' eyes. The woman followed in my steps, head down and gripping my hand. Her hand was trembling and I could hear the short huffs of breath as she tried not to hyperventilate or cry. Making it to the door, I opened it and ushered the woman through first. I almost smiled, realizing what I had just done before I stepped out and joined her. We were surrounded by people.
            
            The woman, I remembered she was a young woman as I joined her side and saw her frozen stance and blank face. The people of the town in the street all stopped and stared at us. A boy who held the hand of his mother asked loudly why we had no shoes. The young woman and I looked down at our bare feet. I wondered why our feet were always bare, or what was happening to our shoes. When I looked at the woman beside me, there was a sense of amusement inside her but the face I saw was still blank, if not with a soft gaze, pleasant.
            
            Looking at her, I studied her face and then her clothes, wondering if there was anything else about us that stood out, and as I looked out at the townspeople, I realized it was not just that we weren't wearing shoes. The boy was calling, trying to get his mother's attention and started to point, but she quickly shushed him and forced his hand down. She combed his hair and urged him to keep his head down as she ushered him away, up the street towards the outer edge of the town. The rest of the people also lowered their heads and continued on wherever they were going.
            
            Our clothes were nothing like theirs. I did not know how to even describe it at first. As we strode back to the main road, the woman hiding at my side and gripping at tufts of my shirt, I took note of what the people were wearing. Whether man or woman, the people were all wearing layered long skirts and boots. As they walked, it was obvious that beneath the skirts, they all wore trousers tucked into the boots. The women's skirts were of patterns favoring colors like red, blue and gold, green, yellow and silver, or black, white and purple. The men's skirts were of prints, such as from wolves, foxes, rabbits and muskrats. The women wore frock coats of a single color taken from among their skirts' patterns, while the men wore pelt coats matching the mix of prints among their skirts.
            
            In comparison, the woman at my side and I were wearing city clothing like jeans and t-shirts, and we were barefoot. Not only were we not dressed like them, we were not dressed for the climate. As I stopped in the middle of the main road, looking down the road towards the gorge and up towards the hills and forest, the woman pressed herself against my back as close as possible with her hands clutching my shirt above my shoulder blades and her face in my hair. Everyone around us stopped to look at us. People in pairs or groups whispered to each other. People on their own stared.
            
            In my reality, I was nearing the hotel lobby but I could not leave the woman here like this. In a sense, I was responsible and I had no idea what would happen to the woman without me. When I left her climbing the mountain side, I came back to find her atop the cliff, having finished the climb, so if I left her here, I would likely come back to find the aftermath of a confrontation. Thinking of the woman, I apologized in my head, wanting her to hear it and feeling her clenched hands tighten, I knew she had.
            
            I was in front of the hotel lobby and though I was sure I was early, when a figure began approaching me from the door, I realized the man had been waiting already. He came out and stood in front of me. He smiled with a cock of his head. Just as he was about to speak, I asked him how to escape a crowd.
            
            “Escape a crowd?”
            
            I nodded and explained the scenario that a pair of strangers found themselves in a town in the middle of nowhere. These strangers wore foreign clothes and so the townspeople could not help but to stop and stare at them. The man started to smile as I continued, saying that one of the strangers was scared of people, so only one of the strangers could take action. “How do they escape?”
            
            “What are the people doing?”
            
            “They're gathered around, staring.”
            
            The man shrugged. “Walk away.”
            
            Returning to the woman pressed against my back, I looked around, lifted my hand to touch one of the woman's clenched hands, and strode forward. The woman stayed close, shuffling after me. I could feel her trembling.
            
            “Does it work?”
            
            Though I heard the man, I could not yet answer as I navigated the woman through the collected crowd. The closest exit from the town was the gorge, and so I led her down the sloping main road to its end at the mouth of the gorge. The people moved out of our way as we passed but they were all silent, staring in what I supposed was astonishment. At the mouth of the gorge, I was about to step in, when the woman ran past me and disappeared among the rocks. I stood, frozen, looking after her, then turned and looked back at all of the people, still watching from up along the main road.
            
            I focused on the man watching me, his greenish blue eyes and pale face, and took several breaths. Remembering his question, I pressed my lips together. “It worked.”
            
            The man smiled and stifled a chuckle. “I'm glad to hear it. Shall we go?”
            
            I wondered what just happened and looked at him, wondering if somehow he understood. It was not likely and what was more likely was that he played along. Thinking of not the closest coffee shop but one with a second floor for seating, I pointed, watching the man for his reactions. Though I knew my gesture was much like what the woman would have done, I could not be bothered to manage myself. The man gestured for me to lead. I stepped forward. He did not move, so I stepped forward again. He hid a chuckle behind his hand, looking away from me. I advanced several more steps and then he started to follow. I stopped. He stayed behind me. I turned back and asked him if he could walk beside me. With a chuckle, he joined me at my side with his hands in his pockets. I ventured a step forward. This time, he mimicked me and looked at me with a smile.
            
            “You are going to walk beside me.” My words were more of a statement than a question but it was still a question.
            
            “Yes,” he said, “If that's how you would like it.”
            
            “I would think that's how many people prefer it.”
            
            He smirked. “Is it?”
            
            “Isn't it?”
            
            His smirk broadened. “Depends on perspective.”
            
            “And what perspective are you taking that you would walk behind me again like a stalker?”
            
            He chuckled from deep in his belly and coughed when he tried to restrain it. Laughing under his breath, he said “How about that it was the perspective I first got your attention from, and I am eager that you continue paying attention to me?”
            
            “But you can have my attention if you're beside me.”
            
            He cocked his head and regarded me. “Is that true?”
            
            I thought about it and realized he might actually be right but how he figured that out so fast, when the vast majority, if not all the people in my life, hadn't at all was possibly troubling. He was gazing at me expectantly and I realized he knew it, he really knew it. “How did you know that?”
            
            He smirked, looking away. “You don't think I tried other ways to get your attention?”
            
            I blanked and I did not want to consider the answer to that. “Let's go.” He chuckled but he stayed beside me as I requested. “So what do you do for a living?”
            
            “If I answer, will you answer as well?”
            
            “No.” I answered without thinking and the man clutched his side, his other hand still in his pocket. While I thought to reconsider and amend it out of courtesy, it would be a lie because I wanted to avoid any talk about myself. Looking down, I added, “I don't like personal questions.”
            
            “Alright,” the man said. He straightened and looked ahead. “Then what is life about?”
            
            I burst with laughter and then registered the question in my head, only to keep laughing. I had to stop and hold myself. Even as I laughed, I found somewhere in my mind, I was trying to think of an answer but I could not believe what question he had asked, how he thought of it so quickly and that he would even ask it, and even as I laughed, aware he was watching me, smiling, hands in his pockets, I could not stop. When I caught my breath, I gasped for each breath, trying not to laugh anymore. When I managed a glance at him, he was still watching with a knowing sort of smile. He cocked his head and said “You have a lyrical laugh.”
            
            “I've been told.”
            
            He tilted his head. “I would suppose that many people would want to make you laugh then.”
            
            I took a deep breath and straightened, and found I was smiling at him so widely, the laughter still coursing through my body. Thinking about those words, I don't know what was happening with my face, I could not change it or there was so much twitching, that all I could manage was “I guess. That's up to them. I don't know.”
            
            He nodded, looking me over, and continued to smile at me.
            
            I breathed out and remembered his question. “So what is life about?”
            
            “What is life about.”
            
            I met his gaze and wondered, “Do you want an honest, real answer or just?”
            
            He grinned. “How about an answer that'll keep the conversation going.”
            
            “Why are you asking for such difficult things?” I could not help but smile and knew anyone else, or many of the people I've ever met, would have laughed at that, but he didn't. He only smiled with a tilt of his head, regarding me with I guessed his better eye and replied, “I only ask difficult things because it doesn't seem as if you will settle for the simple and ordinary.”
            
            “What are simple and ordinary?”
            
            “How was your day? What job do you do? What food do you like to eat? What do you do for fun, or to relax?”
            
            “So simple and ordinary is personal.”
            
            He smirked. “Personal. That's it.”
            
            “That was very roundabout.”
            
            “You said you don't like to talk about personal things.”
            
            “So the word personal is a personal thing.”
            
            He chuckled. “It is very personal.”
            
            I thought back, “Wait,” and remembered something so vague that I could not grasp it, yet “I don't think I said that I don't like to talk about personal things.”
            
            He smirked and looked away. “I assumed,” he said.
            
            I did not want to bother with clarifying as one, it was bothersome, and two, it seemed like I was enjoying this nonsensical, if not pointless, conversation. “So what is life about.”
            
            “What do you think?”
            
            I stiffened. “Now don't ask me that.” I looked at him and he regarded me, eyes narrowing but a curious expression on his face. “I'll say this now but don't. Ever. Ask me what I think or how I feel.”
            
            He cocked his head. “Too personal?”
            
            I scrunched up my nose. “Nonexistent.”
            
            He grinned and stifled a laugh. “Is that so?”
            
            I glanced at him and wondered, “So you answer. What is life about?”
            
            He smirked and looked at me. Lifting his chin and looking away, he ventured a couple steps forward, turning to me and I followed as he held my gaze. He slowed, letting me reach his side as he said “I see life as a limited resource. There is no use wasting its value, but it is an errant manner that allows and persists in the suffering of one's self and others. I find, personally.” He inclined his head to me and smiled. I thought he might wink at me but he didn't. “Observing this abundant yet strikingly rare concoction of material a particular pleasure. I appreciate its value as much as I am able.”
            
            His words were so odd to me. “Then why notice a single person?”
            
            He cocked his head, lifted his chin and thought about it. “Is it not what I said?”
            
            I shook my head. “You said something weird.”
            
            He looked at me. “Did I?”
            
            “Abundant yet strikingly rare concoction of material.”
            
            “Each individual is a unique mixture and blending of experiences.”
            
            I frowned. “Aren't some people annoying?”
            
            He glanced aside, looking at the filth-ridden sidewalks as we continued in silence. His head lowered once he finally answered. “I usually do not engage people.” He turned his head and looked at me, his eyes almost hazy, looking at me but neither seeing nor focusing, and a slight frown along his lips. “I am accustomed to being approached for my insights and expertise, or out of politeness and individuals' insecurity.” When people spoke, I usually had pictures and words displayed in my head, but when he said politeness and individuals' insecurity, the pictures that played, I was not certain of their accuracy, and wondered what he meant. “Politeness or insecurity. Whenever I have a new colleague at work or a potential mentee.” He mustered a smile. “It is only proper to introduce one's self and when one is alone and new.” He took a breath and looked up. “Not many people can handle being alone, and most of those that are, they're alone out of necessity, not choice.”
            
            “I'm alone.”
            
            He lowered his gaze and glanced at me out of the corner of his eye. “Always?”
            
            I nodded. “I'm quite awkward.”
            
            He absorbed my words and seemed to mull them over, facing forward, his gaze down. As we arrived at the coffee shop, I held my hand out. We did not touch. I gestured for us to go in. His eyes scanned the exterior, and with a look of approval, he inclined his head. He held out his arm and gestured for me to go first. As I approached the door, taking the handle and opening it for us, he whispered, “It says much if you yourself say you're awkward.” He grabbed the door from me as I looked at him. Gazing back at me, he had a pleasant smile.
            
            Turning away, I strode in and without waiting for him, I looked around, located the stairs to the second floor and made my way past the tables. When I reached the stairs, I glanced behind me to find the man following. Climbing the stairs, I reminded myself how much I hated them, focused on making it to the top and then looking for some seats. The man followed close behind me as I navigated past the tables, benches and group sitting areas to a small square table beside the window with a pair of black metal chairs on either side. I slid onto one and the man soon arrived, lowering himself onto the other.
            
            “You didn't order a coffee?”
            
            He grinned and chuckled under his breath. “You didn't stop.”
            
            I shrugged. “I'm here.”
            
            He leaned back, having to sit at an angle as the space beneath the table was too small. Crossing one leg over the other and clasping his hands together, he said “Then let's continue our discussion.”
            
            I cocked my head and blinked to myself. “You're not going to get a coffee?”
            
            He shrugged. “I worry. If I leave, you'll leave.”
            
            I looked around at all the people collected among the tables, the benches and in the open sitting areas for groups, people reclining on sofas and bean bag chairs. It seemed ridiculous to run, though I imagined it, but the more likely scenario was my walking away, slipping by, and him returning to an empty table. I felt my face scrunch up at the thought. I did not like it. Shaking my head, I met his gaze. He was watching me and for the moment, I did not mind. “I'm not leaving.”
            
            He tilted his head with a look of knowing. I felt he should say something to that, given the look of knowing he had, yet he said nothing. He continued to watch me, or rather study me, and I took a breath, letting the silence settle. Although I thought of returning to the woman, someone was watching me and I was surrounded by strangers. I also thought of looking around and trying to find an interesting face or sight, except that with this lighting, this casual scene and an interior so common, there was nothing to draw my attention.
            
            As I waited for him to speak, or for an idea of something to talk about, what bothered me was not the silence or even his continuous, watchful gaze. What bothered me was the light in the room, the noise of all the surrounding chatter and the invasive smell of coffee in the air. All of it both did and didn't matter to me. The only reason I wanted us to talk was to have something to focus on, so that I'll tune out as much of everything that I can. What could we talk about?
            
            “You have not answered.” I raised my head and looked at the man. “You have not answered,” he said again.
            
            “Answered what?”
            
            “What is bothering you?”
            
            I frowned. “Bothering me?”
            
            He glanced up. “Is it the lights, our silence, my presence?”
            
            I shrugged. “All of the above.”
            
            He glanced up again. “Does that include god? Many people look up to indicate god's position.”
            
            I rested my teeth on my tongue, not sticking it out, and rather than laugh, I kept it in, so that my abdomen trembled. “I don't think god bothers me.”
            
            He nodded. “So what bothers you?”
            
            “What bothers me,” I said, thinking about god and sitting up to look at him, “is religion. What bothers me is faith and belief.” He cocked his head, smiling, so I continued. “I don't get how people can believe in anything, but then that's just me. But faith. I don't get it. Semantically, faith seems like an intangible noun, do you get that?”
            
            He nodded his head. “Yes. I get it.”
            
            “Right. Yet it's just, in itself, it is a belief. It is another word for believing but it's unconditional and it's almost like. Faith is belief through hardship or adversity. You hold it.” I grasped my hands and I mimicked the people I saw as they were portrayed as I remembered them with their hands clasped over their chests, not their hearts, whether they were singing or praying or crying for someone they have lost. “It's like trusting in the beat of your heart as you walk through the flames of a burning building. It's like my heart is still going to beat as I stop breathing, or as I stand before this gun, or.” I looked at the man. He was listening, except that was my belief as he watched me. Did he actually hear me though?
            
            While gazing at me, he smirked. “And what bothers you about this?”
            
            I lowered my hands and shook my head, knowing exactly what bothered me. “I don't get it.” He held my gaze. “This is personal. Isn't it?”
            
            A grin spread across his lips and into his cheeks. “I would say this is quite personal.”
            
            I leaned forward, resting my elbows on the table and tapping on its surface. “Isn't that strange?” I glanced out the window, glimpsing blue glass, gargoyles and gothic arches, and when I refocused on him, I said “It's more personal than talking about family, about where I live and what I've done and what's happened to me or what I've accomplished.”
            
            “I'm guessing that includes the future.”
            
            I looked in his eyes. “Does it?”
            
            He grinned again. “It very much does.”
            
            “Explain it to me.”
            
            “Anytime we share experience,” he said, bringing up his hand as if offering something to me, “What information belongs to our immediate person, our present time, what defines us as we see ourselves and what others might learn about us, this is personal. Between you and me.”
            
            “But there's a difference,” I said, “You're speaking of personal conversation and personal space.”
            
            “And what is the common denominator between them?”
            
            I looked away, allowing myself to smile, and did not say it but it felt like he earned a point in a game. Catching him tilting his head, I looked at him and realized he had moved to both get my attention and see my face more clearly. Looking at him, I decided I didn't want to remember this conversation, so I smiled and talked. Whatever I said and whatever he said was thrown back and forth, and even as I got involved with the conversation, I sat in the back of my head, waiting for this whole moment to end.`,
            'The Gorge': `When I came back to myself, I sat at my table with my legs propped up by the edge of the bed. The skies were darkening outside and from my seat, all I saw was the view. I could not see the streets or sidewalks below. Time passed by me and for as long as I've been sitting here, I've been frozen, caught in and out of my reality. The woman's reality and the greater reality were both inaccessible. Instead, I was in the darkness of my head, where I waded and waited, managing few conscious thoughts like when and how long.

            As I came back to myself, I searched for the woman and found her sitting on one of the jutting rocks, gazing at something on the other side of the gorge. When I arrived, she turned back and looked at me. She waved and gestured for me to join her. It was night time in the Valley and between large masses of clouds, stars could be seen. I refused to climb the rock, and so changing my sight, I sat with my back to her side and looked up at the stars.
            
            "You disappeared."
            
            "I did." I could see her smile, though I did not look at her. She continued gazing across the gorge and through her eyes, I saw the darkness hanging over the sea of jutting and jagged rocks descending into a ravine populated by trees and shrubs. There was no dragon here. She chuckled.
            
            "Not those dragons," she whispered.
            
            I remembered dragon skeletons, alive and crawling through giant tunnels, lacking most flesh and internal organs. They were long eastern dragons, hollowed out and silenced. As I saw the face of one with pupil less eyes, the ridged snout and silent growl as it exposed rows of teeth, I wondered if I should pity what I had done to once legendary and awe-inspiring creatures. The woman turned and glanced at me. Whipping her head away, she looked up, urging me to look up with her, and when I did, there were eastern dragons rising into the sky from over the mountains. Unlike the ones I remembered from years ago in this reality, these ones were whole, their long scaled bodies contracting and shimmering under the beams of moonlight. When they opened their mouths, their roars shook the air and ground surrounding us. It was such a low, earth-shattering sound.
            
            The woman smiled in wonder. As we watched the dragons rising and flying out of the Valley, even now, I wanted to disappear again. I saw the woman's frown before I saw it on her face as she turned to me.
            
            “Why,” she whispered.
            
            I couldn't answer, only knowing that I wanted to disappear. By being here, my greater self was already withdrawn into herself, and if I disappeared again, what would be left was likely nothing. The woman shot to her feet and peered down at me. She stared into my eyes, then spun away and leapt off the rock. Taking several steps to the next crevice between the towering stones of the gorge, she turned and looked back at me. In her mind, we would walk together as long and as far as we needed. I shook my head. There is nowhere we can go and no distance far enough that would abate my desire to disappear.
            
            She stepped back and faced me, thinking that I wouldn't know if I didn't try. How many times had I thought of walking away and disappearing, yet every time, I stayed, not moving anywhere or doing anything, disappearing here, but now I was trapped. There was nowhere deeper than this.
            
            The woman eagerly shook her head, denying it. I looked at her, a vague recollection and thought forming in my mind, yet it would not take shape as I did not want to acknowledge it. Shaking my head at her, I told her that I did not come here for the past. She gazed back at me, crestfallen, and I wondered what it mattered to her.
            
            I created her just recently. Though we accessed the same memory, there was no use in the time before her. At least, that's what I always told myself when I tried to escape, and that's exactly what this was. Forget the experiment. I heard the woman's scream as it split through my skull and my thoughts, and I had no idea what she said, but as it resonated in my head, I heard “No. Keep going.” I met the woman's gaze. Her eyes seemed full of terror or desperation. I could not accept it, or believe it.
            
            She hurried back up the side of the rock, scrambling up and to my side, grabbing onto my arm. Squeezing, she urged me to go with her. I thought of trekking through the gorge, but she furiously shook her head and gazed at me, her eyes begging me to go with her, and then I saw where she wanted to go, and yet, I could not see it. Like flashes of light and cuts of color, I closed my eyes. She tugged on my arm. “Open your eyes!” I kept my eyes closed, unable to see what she wanted me to see. Instead, I saw a club, opened my eyes and turned to the woman, taking her with me.`,
            'If She Talked to Me': `"Take the medication."

            "I'm sorry."
            
            "There's no use saying you're sorry, Miss, if you'd skipped taking your own medication. Take the medication...Miss. You're sick now cause you stopped taking the medication."
            
            "No."
            
            "Miss."
            
            "No, I."
            
            "Take the medication, Miss."
            
            "I can't."
            
            "Miss. Your medication is right here. Now don't make me force it down your throat cause you know I will. This ain't no hospital. Should I call a hospital for you, huh? Miss? Answer me, Miss. You need to take your medication, you hear me? Are you going to take it or not?"
            
            "Can't you let me suffer?"
            
            "I can but no complaining then, you hear me, you're supposed to be taking your medication. It's all part of the program, you hear, and if they hear you're not taking your medication every night."
            
            "Please."
            
            "Don't you complain then. I don't want to hear a peep out of you."
            
            "I didn't, I haven't."
            
            "That includes any groaning and whining and whatever. Not a peep."
            
            "Okay."
            
            "Okay...Miss, I'm going to leave your medication right here. You look real sick. Take the medication."
            
            "No."
            
            "Okay. Don't go hurting yourself, you hear? Miss. Don't be hurting yourself."
            
            "Okay."
            
            "Good night, Miss. See you in the morning."`,
            'Jan. 17, 2021': `I gasped for breath, unable to ignore the greater reality, and cradled my stomach, pulling my shirt collar from my neck. Even as I gasped for breath, it felt as if I couldn't get enough air, drowning and my guts wrenching, choking as my body jerks and heaves. I fell back and turned my head, trying not to turn over and vomit, except that I knew I wouldn't. I waited and the woman bent over me, looking in my eyes as I heaved and jerked, nothing ever coming out. She grabbed my hand, but was her hand cold or mine? One of our hands was cold, one was searing hot. I held back the whine in my throat, heaving again, my throat convulsing and I almost started crying, but I just wanted to breathe. The hand on my hand tightened and the shivers and chills washed over my spine, my gut tightened. Tears spilled from my eyes. My jaw was trembling.`,
            'Which Reality': `I woke up surrounded by fluffy white sheets, the kind used in nice hotels, in the same clothes I was wearing yesterday, and as I looked around, I found the man at a table in front of a large sitting area with a white sofa and chairs on a rug in front of a flat screen high on the wall. At the back of the sofa, facing the table was a traditional wooden dresser. The man glanced at me, yet returned to whatever he was doing in a notebook with various pencils and a paper cutter. I shifted out from under the sheets, my feet bare, and pressed the pads of my feet against the carpeted floor.

            As I stood, I noticed the balcony doors in front of me, then looked around. Behind me and on the other side of the bed was a counter top leading to an industrial kitchen and beside it was a door with a peephole and brass handle. Beside the door was a three-paneled closet and following along that wall, around the corner and the only fixture parallel to the sitting area apart from a couple abstract paintings was another door. Looking about, I couldn't tell if this was a long-stay hotel suite, given he said he was here for a conference, or an apartment.
            
            "How are you feeling?"
            
            I looked at the man with his head down, hunched over the table with one hand resting on the pencils and drawing with the other. Lifting his hand from the pencils, he grabbed a ruler and began working with it, circling it one way and then another, tracing along its edge. While I wanted to ask him what happened, I knew it from my side. "Why did you bring me?"
            
            He lifted his head and looked at me, hands poised and stationed on the paper. "You weren't responding. Though I led you back to the hotel, you did not move for over an hour. I tried to get your attention but you never told me your name and even when I touched your hand, waved my hand over your eyes, snapped or covered them, you hardly responded other than an autonomic movement of your eyes and head." He released his hold on the pencil and ruler, sitting back with his hands in his lap. "So I brought you here. Would you like some breakfast, some water?"
            
            I sat back on the bed, my hands on the comforter, resisting the urge to grab or clench. Checking in with my body, though after yesterday's experiment, I knew this was pretty much a useless practice, since my greater self gave in and took the medication after I blacked out, I told him, "My name's Shtena, Shtena muunin."
            
            "Miss Muunin."
            
            I shook my head. "I never utter my last name. Nor do I write it."
            
            "And may I ask why that is?"
            
            I shook my head again. "I don't know. At some point, I couldn't stand hearing it or saying it anymore."
            
            "Very well," he said, "And would you like to know my name?"
            
            I looked at him and wondered "Can I guess?"
            
            He smirked. "Go ahead."
            
            "Uumekir."
            
            His eyes widened, and a smile broke out on his face. "Yes. That is. How did you?" I lowered my gaze, tempted to lie back down and sleep. The man shifted about with a rustling of his sleeves and the clatter of the pencils as he collected them. "I'll make some breakfast then."
            
            "What time is it?"
            
            "Half past eight. Thereabouts."
            
            I looked out the windows at gray skies. The curtains were layered and seeing the black-out curtains drawn to either side, one pair framing the wall of glass along the living area and one pair framing the balcony by the bed, I figured this was a hotel.
            
            "What would you like?"
            
            I frowned. My greater self only ate a protein bar and shake for breakfast, but I liked eggs and maybe rice, or maybe toast. Though I remembered liking such foods, I didn't want to eat at all. Lifting my gaze, I expected to find the man at the table but he was in the kitchen. Shifting around on the bed, I watched him from over the counter as he selected a pan. Glancing at me, he smiled and wondered, "Anything in mind?"
            
            I wondered if anyone noticed how familiar he was being and I suppose I should be worried about being alone with him in his hotel room. If he had been anyone else from this or any other reality, then who would not question his familiarity and perhaps forcefulness? Registering his question, I shook my head. When I looked at him, he gazed at me expectantly and I realized he had not seen. "No," I managed but it was soft and I wondered if he heard until he said "Very well. I'll leave some for you should you be hungry later." I nodded, uncertain whether he saw it or not, though it probably did not matter.
            
            Looking back out the window, I glanced back at the man in the kitchen, stood and made my way to the balcony. With another glance at him, I reached through the white sheer curtains, opened the door and stepped out, closing the door behind me.
            
            I almost did not recognize the view as it was completely different from mine and from looking up while walking. The towers in this area were either circular or shaped with tiers, concave and convex sides, indented windows, arches and slopes, made of outward steel skeletons, terracotta and stucco. The breeze was soft and the air was crisp. It tingled along my hands and neck, chills washing over my back like waves. Touching the stone of the balustrade, flattening my hands and seizing with chills up my arms and down my spine, I gazed out at the view of all the towers, and found myself standing in front of my greater self.
            
            She sat on a chair in a corner, her feet up on the bar beneath the seat of a chair in front of her. Though she did not look up, she was aware as I approached and took the chair where she had her feet up. I sat right through the laptop and purse she had on the seat, yet I could see in her mind, through her eyes, there was only me as I sat with my legs to the side and reclined with my arm over the back. It was a position we were very familiar with. She wore in-ear headphones with music playing. While I thought of waiting for her attention, I already had it, so I asked her what we were both waiting to hear. 
            
            "How do we get better?"
            
            She glances up at me and resumes typing me into existence. Her answer is instantly that she doesn't know, except it is something she has brought me here to think about, and I admit, I too want to consider this literal impossibility. We are a very self-aware and self-directed individual. As my greater self has said, teachers, counselors, mentors and managers mostly lost their use to us in our early teenage years, but now, according to my greater self, because she has given up on living, we are here among the homeless.
            
            I would rather correct her that we are here because I am ill. I have no direction for her to follow and so, she stays and floats among the whims and opinions of others. In the doctor's notes, they say she has no sense, or else a confused sense, of self. We have neglected our body and I have lost sight of anything worth caring for, but if the woman is any indication, our body has been sedated. She is giggling like a child and pleasantly gone to fantasy. I don't like where we are.
            
            My greater self produces the image of a smile from beneath her mask. She would tell me that what we like is irrelevant and usually, I would agree with her. That is how we've always lived, it's how we've survived. I tilt my head as I regard her, arms folded and body leaning, and though she continues typing, we are seen in one another's minds. But we're still one person, so she would remind me and I cannot help but laugh. If we're one person, one mind, then truly, we are as fragmented as the doctors all note we are, but is that because we told them so or they have observed it from the way we talk? I am inclined to believe the former.
            
            Our conversation was interrupted when my greater self saw that the older woman whose chore it is the last two weeks to sweep and mop the area left the broom and dustpan leaning against a column. She took the broom and dustpan to sweep the crumbs of another older woman she had gotten to know over the last two months, having felt sorry to let the older woman whose chore it was to clean up the mess that the older woman she was familiar with had left and only wiped over, scattering crumbs and even a chip of chocolate.
            
            The older woman whose chore it was approached my greater self and pretending to be mad, said something like paying her for doing what was supposed to be part of her chore. She only heard some of the words, having to pause the music from her in-ear headphones, and in answer, she just smiled and finished sweeping, returning the broom and dustpan to lean against the column.
            
            Coming back and joining me, my greater self resumed the music, took up her phone and relayed the experience to you and here I've been made to narrate. Now, time is back in sync, and we are back to considering how to treat ourselves of our own ailments.
            
            I take a breath and my greater self buries her fingers in her hair. One of the therapists we have known said it's not typically possible to treat one's self, and we asked him why he said typical. He explained that he said typical because while there is no known case of someone treating their own trauma and disorders, he is open to there ever being one. I wonder if there's no known case or if those who have learned to live with and accommodate the eccentricities of their behavior, episodes or moments of extreme panic or terror, despite building successful lifestyles and loving families, are not considered treated. What does it mean to be well?
            
            Another therapist continuously returns to the notion of a leap of faith we must make regarding our feelings, eccentricity or expression of a true and wholesome self. A psychiatrist we have so far met once said we exhibit counterphobic behavior, and a social worker we met for intake to the second mental health program thus far initially said we do not seem to be having any problem with PTSD, so my greater self rambled off traumatic memories, or rather moments that anyone would consider common causes of trauma, such as rape, lying down and being used for the pleasure of others, loss of a father, the controlling idiosyncratic and confusing social structure of three mother figures, each with their own traumas and triggers, and an emotionally absent older brother, hallucinations, nightmares, trances, learning to sleep on bathroom and kitchen floors due to pain and sickness of eating disorders, and from a life of using my eccentricities and suffering as entertainment for others, accommodating each and every individual's manner of processing information, their social position and interests—Oh, isn't it obvious? I'm not dysfunctional. I'm controlled, contained and crumbling.
            
            So how will we, as they say, get better?
            
            I regard my greater self with disbelief. Though a while ago in her timeline, I encouraged her, what is the use if I give up and if I don't care anymore? If I don't believe, then my greater self can't, and here we are to address the worst question: How will we fix ourselves?
            
            I imagine we have a need for psychosomatic therapy, likely with the use of pressure and movement. Regular full-body massages and yoga or some other exercise might work. I can feel my apprehension, tight in my chest. I've read it before though, from two books that I've read recently. We'll have to wait for what the mental health program will provide, but for now, we're in a homeless shelter, uncertain and unwilling to work with people face-to-face or remotely. An aunt, a close friend to two of my mother figures, once said that I should utter positive affirmations for myself each morning when I wake up. Both then and now I find the practice useless as I have no interest in an absolute without proof or evidence. I am more familiar and comfortable with complexity and the lack of certainty in judgments, but then again, that may be part of my problem as I am excusing my inner fragmentation. It's a web of beliefs and values that protect my current structure.
            
            I grow tired of these thoughts and without a will, we are wasting our time. Is there no way to fix ourselves from the inside?
            
            I clear my mind and in my reality, I find myself slumped in a corner of the balcony with a blanket wrapped around me. Sitting up, I look at the door and find it open. Rising with the blanket and pulling it tighter around my shoulders, I walk back into the man's suite. The man is nowhere in sight and on the table, I notice a slip of paper. Setting aside the blanket, I picked up his note and read: I am attending the conference downstairs. Should you need me call to reception on the third floor, #3. If you're not back when I return, here is my number. I hope we can meet again.
            
            I stared at the digits written at the bottom, then reread the note, taking in the strokes of his writing. He wrote in a cursive-like script with far-reaching slanted letters and bold, precise strokes. In my writing, if I wrote in cursive, I often omitted, repeated or overwrote letters. My cursive always looked messy to me as the letters varied so much in size and space between words and yet, the variation was so constant that it could still be recognized as being written in one hand.
            
            In comparison, people compared my printed writing to that of Arial, the default sans-serif font for many writing programs. They always ask me if I printed my notes, and I always have to point out that they were handwritten. Even though my handwriting had the unmistakable features of connected letters, open o's and undotted i's, and slight variations, whether in pen or pencil, people still asked. As I stared at the man's handwriting, I could not decide if I liked it or not. His cursive-like writing was so neat and traditional.
            
            Reading the note again, I debated whether to stay or not. At the moment, I didn't know where my shoes or socks were. While I figured he put them in the closet, and the thought of him touching my bare feet made my stomach churn, my chest clench and the word confusion appear in my head as if on a teleprompter, it's possible he may have hid them, and I couldn't be surprised if he had.
            
            Stepping back, I looked around and noticing the door beside the living area was open, I walked over. Before closing it, I looked in and found a bathroom. Venturing inside, I located the light switch and flipped it, revealing a long mirror overlooking a two-sink counter and across from it was a large tub. To the right of the counter was the toilet and then a large shower stall with two shower heads and a bench to one side. The shower stall was so big that both sides had a towel bar and inside, I noticed a third shower head in the middle, suspended from the ceiling. When I saw that, I wanted to take a shower but I had no clothes here. Not to mention, this wasn't even my suite. Heading back out, I turned off the light and closed the door.
            
            Following the wall, I made my way past the kitchen to the closet. The panels worked like shoji, though they were more reminiscent of Ming dynasty folding screens. It was odd to see the painting on it, a depiction of the four seasons from plum blossoms to orchids, lotuses and chrysanthemums, over three screens rather than the four, eight and twelve I was more familiar with. The right panel even had Chinese writing in three columns near the bottom right corner of the complete painting. I did not recognize some of the characters and couldn't make sense of it.
            
            Pushing aside the left panel, I found an ironing board mounted against the wall, along with a pair of compartments beneath holding a pair of he-she slippers and a safe. I pushed back the left panel and pushed aside the middle panel, revealing hung coats and a standing suitcase pushed along the side of the compartments. Sliding back the middle panel, I pushed aside the right panel and found my shoes along with several other pairs on a rack and above them were shelves with pillows, an extra blanket and a folded pair of bathrobes. The moment I saw it, the bathrobe, despite its color, was more appealing than my shoes. I wanted to reason with myself but battling with my impulse, it was practically losing, so I slid back the panel and turned away.
            
            I remembered him saying he would leave some food in the kitchen. Wandering into the kitchen area, I looked for the food. I didn't want to linger. Open doors and kitchens made me nervous, I suppose that was the word. The only thing I liked about kitchens was lying on their floor if they were clean. The food was left on a plate in a fancy toaster oven. I stared at it and left the kitchen, heading to the living area. Grabbing the blanket along the way, I wrapped up and curled up on one of the chairs, burrowing.
            
            While feeling my eyes droop, I thought back to my greater self and I could not help pointing out to her that I couldn't really feel too cold or hot anymore. I couldn't even feel the pain when, after we took the medication and mistakenly woke up to relieve ourselves, we hit the floor and scraped our head on a torn metal siding. We were motionless in the black, hearing someone ask "Are you okay" before pulling ourselves up, landing back on our hands between the toilet and stall wall, forcing ourselves up, to flush the toilet and make it back to our makeshift bed before collapsing. That was last night and my greater self had a sore bump on her head.
            
            I did not want to go back to that darkness. Feeling myself slipping, I wriggled out of the blanket and stood. Though I didn't intend to leave, I set about pacing, a habit I haven't engaged in for several months now, regardless which reality I was in.`,
            'Home': `My greater self is using me to scream. The tears that cannot be shed, the shout of “Why can't I have it,” and the motionless being of loss and resignation, she gives them to me, and I take them to the woman, finding her in the gorge. She stands with her head down, staring at something among the rocks, only to jerk and look at me as I approach.

            She takes a breath and regards me, jerking back and forth with the urge to look away from me, but she knows to keep looking at me. I take a breath and lower my gaze, allowing her the relief, except instead, she drops and rolls her shoulders, reaches up and massages her left side, disappointed. Looking at her, I wonder if she has a house somewhere in the town. She snaps her head up, eyes wide and stares at me. I meet her gaze, searching for some image of a place for us to live or stay or meet privately with one another. She smiles, pointing out that we are outside beyond any human eyes.
            
            “Human eyes,” I point out. “I want no eyes.”
            
            Her smile drops and her eyes, open and clear, stare at me. She looks past me towards the town. Frowning, she wonders “You wanted a place?”
            
            Asking myself that question, I turned and looked back up towards the town. We were inside and yet, there was no sanctuary here. As I thought about it, that was the notion of home. I had none in here and when I looked back into my apartment, I knew it wasn't a home. Homes were settled and safe. They were places of free expression, as much as gathering.
            
            When I turned my head and looked at the woman, I felt myself and my greater self start to cry. The woman gasped and I lowered my gaze, watching my vision blur and between the blurs, the droplets fell and caught the light, spotting the rocks. I felt a hand wrap around mine. Lifting my head and looking at her, she met my gaze and squeezed my hand. As I cried, I was compelled to ask her if any of this would serve a purpose. Could she help me? Could she fix me?
            
            She had the answer and as soon as I asked, she closed her eyes and shook her head. My greater self met with one of the therapists, asking if we would be reliant on medications for the rest of our life as we realized that the medications dulled us. The therapist called our reactions unnecessary symptoms and that in going forth, we would need new gauges or measures for our limitations around people, rather than the sickness we've known. When to say stop, when to excuse myself, how to affirm boundaries, I turned to the woman and laid my other hand over hers.
            
            She blinked with disbelief and looked at me. Cocking her head, she furrowed her brows. I mustered a smile and told her, “This much, we can do.” She deadpanned and stared at me in disbelief, and I had to wonder why she opposed me, then it struck me. I'm positive when we're suffering, I'm negative when we're not. No hope, no happiness, no future and no past.
            
            The woman laid her hand over mine, so that our hands were in an alternating pile. “Set some boundaries,” she said, sliding her hands out and with a frown, she shoved me. I saw myself running and came to, stopping in the middle of the hotel suite. When I tried to return to the woman, she sent me an image, the same image of myself running, and insisted that I do it now.
            
            I turned about and looked into the kitchen at the display on the stove. As it was too far, I walked over, finding the time. Though I felt the quickening of my heart and saw the image at the back of my head, I walked back towards the closet, slid open the right panel, and picked out my shoes. Right next to them, my socks had been folded. Narrowing my eyes at them, I wondered if my socks smelled as bad as the socks worn by my greater self. Rather than test it, I unfolded the socks, slid them on, bracing myself against the wall, and then slid my shoes on. Rocking and adjusting the fit of my socks, I reached over and closed the right panel. Then I stopped and stared at the door.
            
            The man was Uumekir, and the woman had no name. What was I to do with my reality?
            
            I closed my eyes and thinking of the word, I saw a house from a cross-stitched image. It was surrounded by bushes full of yellow flowers that ran over the fence posts, the trellises and windows and behind a wave of purple blooms was the cottage-like house with holly wooden walls and a thatched roof and a short door of white walnut wood. I threw the door open and stepped into a dark room with a laminate floor and crumbling stucco walls. 
            
            To the right, I saw such an ordinary living room with a couch and chair of brown suede and an old television set, but in the middle of the back wall was a fireplace so twisted out of proportion that it formed an arch resembling a gaping mouth and in it sat a pile of burnt wood, ashes and coals. The back of the gaping mouth was scorched black and along its lower lip, a jutting seat of stone, there was an engraving of my name. I entered the living room, my bare feet shuffling along the soft carpet.
            
            Through an arch, I found the kitchen with white and teal tiles, an ash wooden table for six at the right and a long counter running along the back wall from a back door with a broken lattice window and shade to a narrow fridge. The sink was deep, made of cracked porcelain and though all the oak wood cabinets looked brand new with intricate trimmings and carved out shapes protruding from the flat octagonal faces, I opened them to find one plate, one cup, one bowl, one fork, one spoon and one knife. There was nothing else.
            
            Backing away, I turned about and found a gaping hole in the floor at the kitchen entrance to the front room with a laminate floor and crumbling stucco walls. The front room was barren, light streaming in through a single narrow window with white lace curtains framing its sides. Gazing into the hole, I saw the top of a staircase. Edging the side, where the darkness seemed to be clinging and crawling in circles, I kept my eyes on the step and froze, imagining reaching over with my leg and a clawed hand seizing it, a heavy weight cracking my shin bone in half and dragging me into the darkness.
            
            I inched my knees over the edge of the hole, gazing at the impenetrable darkness. I wanted to go in, I wanted to go home. Leaning over, reaching out my hand, I fell into the darkness, the cold and silent home of my memory. There was nothing. I floated in and above myself. I was in everything and nothing, free of any body or self that didn't belong, made of the cold, the silence, the air, where no one, not even me, could reach this self, and that was...
            
            Happiness.`,
            'Speaking from the Dark': `What makes a good writer? I wouldn't know but I've thought for so long that writers need material, they need inspiration and research, or one hell of a life story to draw experiences and revelations from. But what was my life until now? I see my memories like flakes of light falling in the dark. If I reach up and catch one on my finger, it will burn but it'll be both warm and painful, and smiling, I will lift that memory to my eye and see the fragments of reality I've known. But I don't want to know that reality anymore.

            I want to lie in the darkness, in my full and wholesome self, and watch the flakes of memories fall, watching their slow descents into oblivion. How tired I am of myself and the life outside and for how long have I debated within myself to pursue life and love on the outside, or settle into the madness and glorious loneliness of this dark wonderful world of mine. Always waiting, trapped in the confines of my body, seeking refuge from memory and interactions, exchanges that never worked in my favor because I was too different or it's my fault because I'm the one who chased myself into the darkness, I'm the one who drove myself to pursue blood and physical pleasure as a child, ever trying to calm down and find peace.
            
            There's no one at fault for the terror of saying no, for my perpetual effort to contain. I will entertain, I will solve your problems, I will listen and I will see you because only the you that is you matters. It was my fault for telling myself don't think, don't feel, or I'm not necessary. It was all my fault. Children can take the blame too, and is this revenge?
            
            If I may destroy myself and wound you in doing so, then let it be my revenge, but if I were to separate children from their family, to take them from their parents and put them in the hands of strangers, how could you accuse me of that revenge? How could you accuse me of taking those children and bringing them into my darkness?
            
            I am this darkness. No one escapes me, yet how rarely will they look at me and know me for what I am. I was in you and all of you were in me. Every face, every name, every person, I hold you all inside me and when you go, you're no more than the flecks of light dancing about and scarring my insides.
            
            But you know what the funny thing is? I can't be me, so I will sink back into myself and drown.`,
            'My Home': `I sat back and smiled to myself, staring into the darkness of the hole. It occurred to my greater self not too long ago that what we need is not so much routines and habits, or the order that pieces together the chaos. What we need is to give ourselves what we can't relate with: comfort, security, safety and familiarity. I reach in but hold myself steady and miniscule particles I can't even see land on my hand and burn the skin where they lie.

            I see a cell phone in my hand as I walk between a living area and dining area, reading and singing the original song that I thought had the words "ugoy ni nanai" but it was "sa ugoy ng duyan." The sight of the lyrics, dining table and chair arms and legs, the feeling of walking, singing and the flashes of light from the beams through the glass doors converges and becomes a plate of homemade yellow crepes in a small, worn down toaster oven and filled with both confusion and excitement, I call out to my mom if I can eat them all. There's the rustling of her standing from her seat and I wait, listening to her shuffled footfalls as she says not all of them, and comes rounding around the fridge.
            
            Her face becomes that of her father's, a dark-skinned old man with age spots and a cowlick. He looks down at me and asks if I would like some crackers and curious, I say that I would, so he turns and leads me into his and grandma's bedroom, waving for me to sit on the bed as he opens the cabinets of his dresser, stoops down, and reaches far in towards the back, pulling out a large tin that looks like it was for Christmas cookies. When he twists it open, he reaches in and pulls out crackers, which he puts in my hands and holds a finger to his lips. "Don't tell your grandma."
            
            I pull back my hand, seeing golden glowing burns along my thumb and the knuckles of my middle finger. Wiping them away, my skin is left unscathed. I stand and round the gaping hole into the living room and to the front room towards the door. Before opening it, I already know what I will see, and as the sunlight reaches my eyes, I step into the garden and look past the overgrown grasses and stalks of glowing yellow and purple blooms, and to my left, I find the field, forest and mountains, then to my right, I find the stream and the top of the town's slope. This was the worn down cottage.
            
            Looking about, I freeze at the sight of the woman standing in front of the garden's gate. She rocks on her feet, one arm behind her, and gazes at me. She steals a glance at the gate and musters a smile. Walking up to the gate, I open it for her but she doesn't step in. Instead, she leans and looks around me. She lifts her gaze to mine. I look back at the house, or cottage. Though it had a kitchen, it was not a place to live in. 
            
            "You can't say that."
            
            I turned back to the woman, urging her to explain. She shrugs and points at the cottage. Following her finger, nothing seems different when I look at the cottage's exterior but an image enters my mind of the chair, couch and old television set melting away and becoming stuffed animals that were almost life-like replicas of a bear, wolf and leopard. The bear shakes its head and groans as the wolf staggers to its feet. It breathes in and out, and with a growl, it throws back its head and howls. The leopard watches the other two and slinks to the side of the anguished gaping mouth of the fireplace and on either side of the fireplace, the walls become murals of stone, the stones taken like pebbles from the beach and fitted together.
            
            The wolf skulks into the kitchen as the corner wall splitting the living room from the front room and kitchen dissolves and the hole in the floor becomes a square well, marked by smooth concrete lips. In the kitchen, the wolf sniffs the air and paces about as the cabinets, sink and fridge morph into shelves with children's picture books, illustration books, and then philosophy, design, art and psychology, but the bottom three shelves hold floating glass fixtures. The wolf sniffs at the glass fixtures and chooses a red one to snap between its jaws, and so the glass becomes bits and a chunk of meat, which the wolf licks up to eat.
            
            Hearing the sounds of eating, the leopard and bear enter the kitchen. The bear is drawn instantly to the smell of a golden yellow fixture, which becomes honey in its jaws, and the bear plops down to lick at its paws and the floor. The leopard takes another red fixture, setting it on the floor and watches it become a slab of meat. As the three feast, the front room produces more doors that would logically lead to the outside, but there are five of them, colored red, blue, yellow, green and orange, another two forming on the ceiling of pink and brown, and two on the floor of purple and black.
            
            Turning to the woman, I frown at her. She grins back at me. Stepping in, she closes the gate behind her and offers her hand for me to take. I hold my hands at my back. Deadpanning, she sets one hand on a hip and again, holds out her hand, pushing it out to me, urging me to take her hand. She flutters her lashes at me, her expression still deadpan. I draw one of my hands out, looking between her gaze and her hand, and slowly, I rest my hand in hers. Smiling, she grips my hand and leads me back to the door of the cottage.
            
            I looked over at the town and right as I imagined people coming up to notice us, "Don't" resounded in my head. I turned and looked at the woman who glared at me, squeezing the blood out of my hand. No one appeared at the eastern end of the town, where the cottage sat.
            
            I stopped, feeling my feet stop and looked out to find myself in my apartment. Looking to my left at the kitchen counter, cabinets, stove, sink and fridge, and then behind myself, I found the door open. I walked over and closed it, then slumped down to the floor. The ceiling was white. I followed the expanse of its surface to the edge of the back wall and lowered my gaze to the windows that oversaw other buildings and the streets. Meanwhile, my greater self was walking over hills, just to see the green walls of a community home. She chose to keep walking, and I continued to stare at nothing, closing my eyes and setting my head back against the door.
            
            What place do we want to live in, and the answer was always none. We don't want to stay anywhere. There is no home here, wherever here can be. All we can do for now is pass each day with the reassurance that as long as we keep moving, keep doing a little better, there will be a day that we can leave any and all places. I'm with you, that's what I tell my greater self, and when I'm lonely, she says it back. Not today. She's not saying it to me today. Her eyes are drawn to nice-looking exteriors but with no more than a glance, she returns to me. Earlier, she spotted the bell tower of a church and I was with her but a second like a blink of the eye, yet that's where I want to go now.
            
            Seeing a classic red-brick steeple with adjoining halls and a bell tower, I find myself at its steps, cracked and across the middle step, a part is broken as if someone had dropped a wrecking ball on it. The front is framed with white, rows of dorian columns holding up a room above and leading to an entrance of three double doors, painted with murals of angels on both sides.
            
            I went up the stairs, avoiding the cracks and slanted middle step, passed the columns and entered the church, at once assaulted by the stale smell I had always associated with the carpeted floors of churches, and the burning candle wax from racks of candles lit for prayer. On either side of the long pews stood stained glass windows depicting the stations of the cross. Although there were a few people inside, one at the front kneeling between the pews, a few gathered in front of a rack of candles to pray, and some people whispering to the side, talking about how to prepare for the next mass, I cleared them all away.
            
            As I walked through, I changed the floors, first to stone, then to concrete and then to carpet but none appealed to me. I stopped halfway down the central aisle and looked up at the altar, the hanging fixture above it, the sculpture of Christ on the cross, the white walls and red banners. The ceiling was formed from beams set at angles to support one another along a central beam and from the ceiling hung not only chandeliers but twisting glass at varying heights. Seeing the mixtures of red and gold within the glass, as well as blue, gold and orange, I changed the floor to black and white marble. The pews were no longer wood seats but stone benches. The racks of candles became shelves with hooked edges, allowing rolling ladders to move side to side, which sightless candle bearers, their eyes no more than smooth flesh, would climb, lifting the candles and lighting them.
            
            Striding toward the front, I changed the sculpture of Christ to an actual man, his blood dripping from the nails impaled through his hands and feet, his chest heaving and his head bowed from the weight of a thorn crown, from which blood dripped down his face and through his hair. I came up to the steps leading to the altar, set with a white cloth, candles, and the symbols of the church. I turned the white cloth to layers of cream pineapple thread, removed the candles and set the symbols of the church into the sides of the altar. The man on the cross opened his eyes and glanced at me.
            
            Rounding the altar, I went to the chair of the priest, climbed into it and reached towards the feet of the man. He trembled as he watched me and I laid my hand over the nail through his feet, felt the sticky blood and fresh blood around the nail, and the roughness of his dry, dirt-covered skin. He cried softly without tears as he felt my hand on his foot and when I looked up through his hair, I saw the gaping mouth twisted with anguish, heard the gurgles and soft cries, and looked into the eyes of a miserable man.
            
            What I found was only fascination and admiration, I felt no guilt or mercy, whatever such feelings entailed. I did not want to prolong his suffering but neither did I want it to end. Lowering myself, I sat down in the chair of the priest, staring at that gruesome face covered in dried and dripping blood, the trembling lips, the gaping twisted mouth and the eyes so dark, that could hardly stay open from the blood trickling over and around them.
            
            I could easily imagine why a sadist, not one for sexual pleasure but for general appreciation of the human experience, would love coming to church. Whether the mass was an hour or two, watching this man suffer was a sight to behold, and this wasn't satanic. What would be satanic, and this thought I sent into the mind of the man on the cross, would be to take him down after a while, lay him on the altar, and while still alive, gut him, feel around inside and cut out his heart. The man closed his eyes, turned his head away and whined. Inescapable fates, those were the words I thought of as he once more lowered his head, giving in to the ache and burden of his crown.
            
            I wanted to imagine that the field outside my cottage was full of people on burning pyres and impaled by wood spikes, that the grass would blacken and thicken with the blood drained, dried along the sides of the spikes and turn to ash as the fires creep down the wooden spikes of the pyres to spread out towards the forest, but it would venture no further than that as I could see the woman standing outside the cottage, staring at all the bodies and flames, smelling the cooking of their flesh and the burning wood. All were already dead. Only the crackle of the fires could be heard. I looked up into the face of the man on the cross and heard the woman ask me, "What have you done to this place?"
            
            Seeing the fire and bodies through her eyes, I answered. "It's home."
            
            Her whole body trembled and tears spilled from her closed eyes. She lowered to her knees and down onto her hands, unable to breathe anything else than the smoke from charred flesh and blood.
            
            "You monster," the man spat and I wondered if there was a smell in the air or screams throughout the village. There was none I could detect and so I cocked my head at the man, continuing to look through his hair at his contorted face, his lip pulled back with a snarl. I heard his words register in my head and it sounded so gruff, his voice unused. "How can you do that to innocent people?"
            
            I found the words so strange and smiled. "Define innocent," I said.
            
            "What harm," he said in a groan, stopping to tremble and cringe, forcing himself to look at me through slitted eyes, "What harm have they ever caused you?"
            
            I thought about it. Of course the answer was none and I wondered why that mattered. Sending this thought to him, he heard it with a low moan like he would start crying out loud. I hoped he wouldn't. It wasn't a sound I found tolerable. The pain radiated through his head, so I thought about his question and accusation, and the answer he actually wanted was easy. This world was mine to do with, I saw it no different than a room of toys and the people, well, as people, they were no more and no less. I saw them as nothing special. While I didn't see them as disposable or extra, they were no different to me than anyone else, and there was still a great deal of them left.
            
            I doubted that the people burning in the field even belonged to the town. I had no sense of the faces and names here, so whether these people were suddenly created by me or came from the crowds I wandered through before, that was all perception like the crafting of a narrative. The process of any craft was not as linear as it seems because there are always the details to drive the process one way or another, to delay or detour, and only in the end, when we can sort the order and extract the useless from the useful, then the linear narrative remains. Those people drained of blood, burning in the fields, may not have been anyone from the town and when I find the mind of the woman at the edge of the field, I know through her that they weren't. She will not contribute to a more horrific narrative.
            
            I looked up at the man and wondered when he would die. It was not something I looked forward to but with his hands and feet impaled, a thorn crown on his head, it seemed more probable that he would die of hunger or thirst than blood loss or another affliction, presuming he had no illness, but then if any of the injuries became infected, such as by contamination of the nails, thereby causing tetanus, maybe he would die sooner. To die of starvation or dehydration would not be as miserable as to die from a severe infection. I wanted to watch, yet as soon as I considered it, I heard a hard vibration and felt it through my body, realizing that it was my cell phone in my back pocket.
            
            Returning to my reality, I had my cell phone out in my hand by then, looking down at the unknown number. The origin of the number registered as symbols, which I realized spelled Uumekir. I blinked with disbelief and couldn't believe my phone was still vibrating. Answering, I asked him how he got my number. He said I left it. I thought back but there were no memories since the time I was in his suite and decided to run, if that's what I decided.
            
            "Are you alright?"
            
            "What?"
            
            "Are you alright?"
            
            "Why are you asking?"
            
            He did not immediately answer and the silence that answered me put me on edge. I did not want to think about it.
            
            "If you're alright, can you recount the last hour for me?"
            
            I couldn't and the urge that rose first was a defense, bit back before it could form in my mouth. My silence answered him.
            
            "Does this happen often to you?"
            
            "I've always had problems with memory."
            
            He did not speak for a second. "Do you know why?"
            
            No one ever asked me that question, and while I could account for half the time, I couldn't the rest. My memory was dedicated to the contradiction, the outlier or outstanding case. Otherwise, it was all about making sense of the world through an eternal pursuit of universal objective truths, concepts that held true of human nature regardless of circumstances and conditions, but usually through the lenses of neuropsychology, history and philosophy. There were few of my memories that could not be categorized as either. They were memories I held solely for the sake of their beauty, as well as every moment of pain or fear I have ever endured.
            
            There was one memory of my mother that puzzled me, and my greater self recalled it in therapy. Though I was aware of it, to be so frightened by her rage, I'm surprised I didn't pee myself or run away at the time, but then I heard children aren't given much option. When fight and flight aren't possible, they are left with the only survival skill left: freeze. To remember that someone stood in her way like a physical barrier, talking at her, trying to reason at her as she glared, pointed and paced, and shouted at the top of her lungs, moving as if to shove them aside, I was removed from the overwhelming terror of the little girl I had been, backed against a wall, and from the floor, watching her mother like that, and yet, at the same time, therapy was pulling back the beads and stringing them into a narrative I was not familiar with.
            
            "Shtena Muunin, do you hear me?"
            
            "No." I came back to his voice but I didn't want to.
            
            "How about staying with me for a few days?" I couldn't get his words in my head. "I would like to monitor your condition."
            
            "We just met."
            
            "I understand that, are you taking any medications?"
            
            "You're not my doctor."
            
            "I am not."
            
            "Are you a doctor?"
            
            "You did not want me to divulge any personal information."
            
            "You didn't answer my question."
            
            "I would rather adhere to the limits you have placed."
            
            "That I've placed?"
            
            "Yes."
            
            "You stalked me from the store. You brought me back to your suite. As far as I've seen, you get your way."
            
            "I do. I will not deny that."
            
            I couldn't get his words in my head. He was saying something, I was getting to something. Happening too fast was not a concept here. How badly I wanted to ask him what he wanted but how futile that was, knowing. He was clear from the beginning and he never made any attempt to hide it. I could hear his breath, how he exhaled and said "I'm aware that trying to convince you at this moment may not be possible. What I've suggested is very forward and perhaps untimely. But I would like you to consider."
            
            "Why?"
            
            "Because I would like to help you."
            
            "I have learned that such words should never be spoken."
            
            "And why is that?"
            
            "How would you help me?"
            
            "In any way I can."
            
            "Would you do anything?"
            
            He was silent, and I waited. Everything I just said, I couldn't even believe I'd said and was replaying my words, trying to make sense of our conversation, of what was happening in my head. Did I think he was dangerous? Was I even capable? My history would oppose me, telling me that I have no sense of danger, or just limitations and healthy boundaries. I've always engaged beyond my ability and even allowed people to have their way, waiting for the opportunity to run and abandon everything. There are no reconciliations in my world. In my world, there are only users, strangers and people with names that seem to care about me.
            
            "Shtena Muunin."
            
            I held my breath and wondered if he noticed the difference.
            
            "How did you know my name?"
            
            "I guessed."
            
            "You didn't look me up."
            
            "How would I have done that?"
            
            "You could have called down to the hotel staff, even explained your situation, and they would have likely abided."
            
            "Wouldn't that incur you?"
            
            "Not necessarily."
            
            "If I looked you up."
            
            "Nothing you would find interesting."
            
            "What do you think I'd find interesting?"
            
            "That, I don't know, but I can wager that you have no interest in achievements like honors or awards, not even occupational advancement and high ranks."
            
            "I don't."
            
            "Then I have won my own wager."
            
            "You have. What else?"
            
            "What else might you not be interested in?"
            
            "Yes."
            
            "You might not be interested in my social media statuses or posts. You do not care for how the world sees me or even how I interact with it, what would you say?"
            
            I remembered our first conversation, where he mentioned the notes of what people have said about him, and remembered that I'd asked him how other people would describe him, or something like that. A blue painting. "If I don't care how the world sees you, why would I ask how other people would describe you?"
            
            "From what I saw, you were more interested in what I would say than what those descriptions might be."
            
            For some reason, I saw the glass where I noticed him following me, that he appeared like a shade at the corner of my eye, and what he said about the way to see him, to notice him, was in my reflection. "What would you do, why do you think I need help?"
            
            "You did not respond to me, though I waited for over an hour, standing with you by the hotel lobby. This morning, I found you, hardly conscious, on the balcony and when I tried to move you, you resisted and huddled in the corner."
            
            "I am not that removed. Am I?"
            
            "That may be indication enough, I'm afraid. I do not know how you perceive your own behavior but anyone who has witnessed it would likely have been disturbed by it."
            
            I can recall times that people have yelled a bit to get my attention and when I finally looked at them, they mocked me or scolded me before continuing their business. When I thought of staying with Uumekir though, my chest tightened and shivers rolled down my spine, collecting in my gut. I was so scared of being next to another person, that he might touch me and I might have to lie under him and wait for the waves to cease. Would being with him become too stressful for me and again, manifest in medical anomalies that can't be explained? And yet, I wanted to be there.
            
            I wanted the chance to know. What everyone else had, whatever it was, whether that was warmth or comfort, I wanted just one person in this whole world, just one, who could give me a home, but I would never want what I cannot have. I will not pursue or chase people around for personal gain, because gain meant loss. I do not hope, and this was no exception.
            
            Before I could reject the man's offer, the woman appeared, kneeling right in front of me. She stared at me with puffy eyes, a pale face and reddened nose, and thinking of my last interaction with her, I wondered if she had just finished crying over the people in the field. How could a person like me with such thoughts as mine be acceptable? These were not thoughts to be shared with anyone, except perhaps another friendly but sadistic psychopath.
            
            Looking at the woman, I asked her what she would do. She lifted her hand and rested it over mine holding the phone. The thought she sent to me was not to hang up but also neither to reject nor accept. Staring into my eyes, she leaned forward, rested her forehead against mine, took a breath and sighed. She urged me to breathe with her and I could feel myself choking, my heart racing and I gasped for breath, gasped for air but I couldn't get enough. She lowered her hand to my wrist and squeezed. I kept my mouth agape but withheld all possible sound, not wanting to be heard. I started to cry and bit my lip, holding the phone away. The woman reached for my hands, but denying her, her hands went right through mine as I dropped the phone.
            
            She stared at her hands and then at me, and holding onto my breath, my whole abdomen trembling, I managed to watch her. Her eyes pleaded with me to let her touch me. I shook my head. I couldn't even touch myself, my hands hovering and my legs split, one partially raised. The door against my back and the floor under my legs, but what I couldn't stand was just the thought of any part of my body touching another part. I couldn't stand it!
            
            Make me disappear, I begged her, let me go back to the cottage and the hole. That's my home, that's me. Let me go.
            
            She stared at me, eyes full with shock, and I continued to beg her because I couldn't go back. For some reason, I couldn't leave. Even thinking of the hole, I was still here, stuck in my body that I couldn't stand, and the woman only stared at me. How do I get out?
            
            I scrambled to my feet, tolerating the feel of my legs grazing one another, and strode to the balcony door, pulling it open, and stepping out, I latched onto the cold metal of the rail, the icy chill of the air and sucked it into my lungs, sinking to my knees across the metal grating. Resting back but stopping before I could rest on my haunches, I held the position, even as my thighs began to shake with the strain. I was aware of my hair on my back and resisted the urge to hold it up.
            
            I remembered times as a child when I couldn't stand the feel of my hair on my neck, the strands tickling my skin, and laughing, I would hold it away, laughing at just the thought of the sensation, but just as often, there were times that for any part of my body to be touched by another part was so disgusting, so distressing that I would cry and cry, not knowing what to do or how to stop the feeling that just seemed to intensify in my head.
            
            I would either cry myself to sleep, so exhausted that I could not register the disgust or distress, or whatever that feeling was, or seek one of two alternative sensations: cold and hot. I'd look for all-consuming cold like that found at the bottom of an icebox or outside in the middle of winter, or I'd look for something hot like a heater's metal grate, the surface of the toaster oven while heating up some food, or less likely the side of a straightening iron. As the latter was more likely to scar, I more often pursued the former, even for other reasons, and right now, it worked.
            
            I lowered my head, lowered my body and slumped forward. Catching myself, I slowly allowed my head to rest against the metal bars. It crossed my mind that someone might see but I knew I was practically invisible. Our brains were attuned to what's different and what's the same, automating and regulating things of the same kind to their categories or processes, while different things were given attention to decipher, re-interpret and assimilate. But similarity was easily ignored or unseen. Someone like me might be sick from a hangover or trying to get away from an argument. Someone sitting out in the cold on their balcony might be high or drunk. I could be mistaken for them or easily explained, and moreso, I was the bad day, the embarrassment, the screw up that a person didn't want to remember, and so I am invisible.
            
            I resisted the urge to lie down and close my eyes but my eyelids were drooping. As tired as I was, I wondered if I could make it to the cottage, past the life-like trio and slide into the hole. Even as I saw it, I couldn't. It did not matter that my eyes were open. I was stuck in my body and my reality, and I gave in, laying myself down, touching my cheek to the metal grating. I settled on my back, legs bent, keeping away from the bars, and looking forward, looking up, I stared at the white skies, not a hint of sunlight or blue. The cold settled along the metal grating seeped through my clothes. I shivered from my shoulders and down my spine. My eyelids continued to droop, yet I remained on the edge of sleep. Even as my breathing eased, I would not sleep.
            
            Forcing myself up, I reached to the bars for support and hoisted myself up, leaning against the bars. I heard a click and imagined a key pressed into a lock. There was another click and a step followed by a third click. I closed my eyes, breathing slow and shivering, enjoying the cold seeping into my skin. When I heard some soft thuds, I imagined drums until they stopped and I continued to breathe nice and slow.
            
            I heard a sigh, so I think, then I knew I heard it as he said "In this, you are predictable." I should have been shocked, feel a spike of adrenaline and sit up, but the calm remained. My eyes were open. I looked down at the streets, the people with shabby clothes and matted hair, sauntering around their tents and scattering their trash about. They looked like toys, those tiny toy prizes in plastic eggs. I heard rustling, looked over and found the man sitting on the floor on the other side of the open door. He was watching me.
            
            "How did you get in?"
            
            He smiled. "I convinced your landlord that I'm your doctor."
            
            "Did you call an ambulance?"
            
            "I told him it may not be necessary. I have already messaged him that all is fine."
            
            "He gave you a key."
            
            "Yes. He did."
            
            "Will you abuse your power?"
            
            "I might. I admit it's a possibility I would consider when regarding you. How are you feeling?"
            
            "Fascinating."
            
            He cocked his head.
            
            "How fascinating did I seem that you would?"
            
            He tilted his head down, smiling. "More fascinating than you can imagine."
            
            "I don't understand."
            
            "Why don't you think you would fascinate me?"
            
            My mind caught the word, fascinate, as in a philosophy of personality categories that some woman named Hoghead came up with. To think of myself as a fascinating person, I could remember that numerous people throughout my history found me eccentric and entertaining. The things I would say, how I moved and what I wore always caught people's attention, even more so when less inhibited, though I stayed away from all substances, whether drugs, alcohol or smoking and vaping. My lack of inhibitions was a natural aspect of my personality, one I often tried to keep to myself as it made me too forward, honest and even a distraction. It also hurt me as people would become too attached or attracted, forcing themselves on me.
            
            I heard his question again and said, "I don't doubt that I might have been fascinating. People often help me to great extents, willing to do a lot, because they like me, or because I'm honest and I've returned the favor, or it's their culture and they believe they should be so helpful. So what you're doing doesn't necessarily stand out to me. But something is telling me it should. I'm not doubting you and I'm not rejecting, though I think I should. I'm aware you're so straightforward, and yet, I'm not. I can't be sure what you want."
            
            He smiled with a softened gaze. "I want you. Could there be any other way?"
            
            "In what ways?"
            
            "In all ways that you are capable.”
            
            “I'm not capable.”
            
            He grinned. “Which way, could you specify?”
            
            I tilted my head and stared at the wide grin on his face. “Do you want me to love you?”
            
            His eyes widened. “Love.” He looked away and took a breath. His gaze shifted to me. He turned his head, an odd smile on his face. “I have not considered it.”
            
            “You want me.”
            
            “Yes.”
            
            “But what does that mean?”
            
            His gaze lowered as he seemed to mull it over. Without looking at me, he whispered “To know.” He lifted his head and met my gaze. “I want to know all of you that there is to know. Your every gesture, your every thought, how you move and how you sit. Every secret. Every angle. I want nothing about you to escape me. I want you, your every part and feature in all its possibilities, committed to my memory.”
            
            I could not tell if what I felt was disgust, desire, confusion or uncertainty, but as I looked at him, the presence of his words lingering, his words became bits of images, and I wondered “You want to have sex with me?”
            
            He leaned back, his back stiffening, never breaking eye contact. “Sex would be a means to know the appearance of your every physical feature.” I knew he was watching my expression and body language, but I only knew of the hunch of my shoulders, leaning against the bars and shivering. “While that would satisfy a small, superficial piece of what I would like to see, to settle for it would leave me. Wanting.” He leaned forward, eyes narrowing, holding my gaze, and it felt like a weight sitting on my chest. His eyes were in my head. “I don't settle for any less,” he whispered and each word was a chill across my arms. “Only what I want.”
            
            My gut wrenched so tight. I could not look away but the meaning of his words, the weight of them, settled over my skin and I started to heave. I forced myself to look down, focusing on every errant sensation, letting nausea take over, but knowing that he was watching, I turned my head away and gasped for breath, not willing to show him my dry heaving or choking. I saw flashes of the other buildings, the sky, the bars by my face and gripped the metal in my hand, the shivers traveling through my arm and rolling down my spine.
            
            I noticed movement and found him standing. He fixed his clothing as he stepped out and sat down beside me. I kept my gaze down, keeping him in my peripheral, trying not to seem so sick in front of him, wishing I could disappear now, except he was too close and too aware.
            
            I saw his hand reach out and tightened, prepared to feel his touch, and he grabbed me by the back of my neck, a firm hold that my body rejected. I convulsed, holding in cries and gasping for breath. It was warm and the pressure of his hand guided me to lean towards him as a hand took hold of my shoulder, and I felt steady. He leaned in. I stiffened. Beside my ear, he told me to focus on him. Breathe in, breathe out, focus on him. “I'm here, Shtena Muunin.” I focused on the hand holding my neck, the hand bracing my shoulder, and the strangest thing I can ever remember happening, I relaxed.
            
            It was almost like being home but my body was here and it was warm. How could I ever describe this feeling? It was so unfamiliar and strange, that all through my body was a calm, a sense of safety so pervasive that I could forget everything else. My eyelids drooped, my body leaned forward, and I could smell the man in front of him. His scent was warm. It reminded me of wood, salt and citrines, yet it was darker, milder, earthier. I wasn't finding any of the right words.
            
            Forcing my eyes open, I lifted my head and looked at him. Though his face was fuzzy and all I knew were the colors and his scent, I wanted myself to remember this one thought. I wouldn't say it out of fear, but I needed my whole self to hear this. I needed to remember this: Could this man show me home?`,

        text: `Warm light streamed through a slit in the outer doors, stirring Angela from her sleep. She jerks when it flares and birds start swooping and whistling outside. Rising from the sheets, she fumbles a little, trying to navigate the hard floor and her meager beddings. With her hair in frazzled disarray, squinting, tan bony fingers frantically searching her proximity, given a soft grunt, she locates her glasses where once she had lain them. She slips on her glasses, then surveys the room.

        The room is far from impressive. Plastic covers the paneless outer doors leading to a run-down washroom, walls are cracked, the concrete partially painted and mostly peeling, cockroaches and ants create morning traffic on the floor and in dark corners, and there is absolutely no furniture.
        
        Angela licks her lips and stands, scratching at her greasy black hair. She saunters to the outer doors, waits a moment to slide one side open, pushing on the metal frame that shrieks as it moves aside. Instead of stepping out though, she first leans towards the washroom, sniffing one way then another. She hardly flinches at the smell of backed up sewage and stale piss. Her gaze passes over the hole in the ground and the rocks piled up in the corner as she pulls back, sliding the door shut. Returning to her bed, she finds a cockroach hopping on the pillow. It clearly senses her and scurries away, weaving recklessly across the floor, only it never reaches the wall, squashed with a resounding crunch as a heavy slipper slammed down on its long, red body. Angela strolls up close, picking up the slipper to stare at the flattened victim. She cocks her head, recalling the red vermin¡¯s hopping from less than a minute ago. A fleeting thought causes her temporary pity at killing the nuisance. However, it is called “fleeting” for a reason and the next instant, Angela turns away, stripping off her sweat-soaked shirt.
        
        She pauses. Slowly, she brings the shirt up to her nose for a whiff of it. Disgusting, she thinks, tossing the shirt aside. Then she proceeds with further removing the rest of her clothes.
        
        Left nude a few moments later, Angela wanders to a kitchenette in the corner adjacent to the washroom. Half the counter sinks into a pile of rubble and stones. The pipes stick out from the wall and the sink consists of a rusted faucet and bucket. She turns the tap, letting the water run as she stretches her joints. Her neck strains. Her shoulders pop. She moans as her spine cracks once, then twice, followed shortly after by her knucles over her head. Then she stops the tap, the bucket almost overflowing.
        
        She reaches towards the shelves below the finished half of the counter, where she pulls out unmarked bottles of product, setting them on the counter top. In total, three bottles stand on the counter, along with a dipper and a stained towel with tattered, unraveling corners. Her gaze wanders briefly over her amenities. Gaze wandering out further, she mindlessly reaches out for the dipper, gripping the handle, and bringing it towards the bucket of murky water. There, in the kitchenette, standing on concrete and abandoned kitchen tiles, she repeatedly dunks the dipper in the bucket, raising it out full, and dumps the water over her head, her back, and the rest of her limbs, letting the water run its course on her skin. She lathers up her hair, washes out the suds, spreads the soap across her skin, and splashes herself, washing it all away. Once finished with her bath, she stands still, staring at the bucket of dark water, then to the floor, and her amenities.
        
        With the remaining water, she douses the floor.
        
        She gives the whole floor a passing glance over before grabbing the towel and returning to the small area that her beddings take up. At the edge lies a bucket with discarded garments and a zipped-up duffel bag. Before plopping down on the edge of the beddings, she spares a moment to pick up her discarded clothes and throw them to the bucket. Then on her bed, she proceeds to pull the duffel bag up to her side and rummage through its contents, pushing them back and forth, reaching under and digging blindly inside. Though she manages to pluck a pair of shorts and a t-shirt from the bag, she continues searching, yet never looking at what she has touched on. Eventually, she stops. She sits back and stares at the bag, the towel draped across her shoulders, her hair dripping, and the pair of shorts and t-shirt lying in her lap.
        
        She was missing underwear, and a bra.
        
        Angela continues staring at the bag, face blank as she rests, unthinking. On a sudden-impulse decision, she stands, the shorts and shirt clutched in one hand as she allows the towel to slide off her back. She slips them on, first the shorts and then the t-shirt, but then adjusts them a little, waits, hesitates, and adjusts them again, pulling on the shirt's armpits, pulling down the crotch, straightening the hem, and tugging on the collar. A slight frown settles on her face as she stills again. She scowls.
        
        Heading to the door, she stops to put on some shoes, straightens and undoes the locks, and with the door open, snags a purse dangling from the valve of an exposed pipe in the wall. She spins out the door, donning the purse. The door slams shut in her wake, leaving only the ring of the metal and the sound of her fading footsteps in the empty room.
        
        “I'm okay, yeah. I got it. Yeah, it's great! I love my room, really. Yeah?”
        
        Early evening, Angela steps back into the room, a cell phone to her ear and a fake smile on her lips. She closes the door softly, keeping the sound of it out of the call. There are several locks and bolts on the door that she carefully does one by one, not wanting the sound of them to reach the phone either. At the last, she looks them over, internally reassuring herself of her security before backing up and away. As soon as she turns around, she fans her shirt a little. In the dim light, she makes out the outlines of the kitchenette counter, the faucet and bucket, her beddings, the bucket of clothes and her duffel bag, and even some of the cockroaches wandering freely about. First, as she listens on her cell, she hangs her purse on the protruding valve, and then saunters into the middle of the room. Her gaze shifts to the paneless window above the kitchenette with bars in a grid over the square cut-out from the concrete walls.
        
        She keeps listening and musters a smile. “That's good! Have they thought of a date yet?” She laughs lightly at some comment, which ends with a soft smile and sad eyes as she continues listening. “I think, it's good, it's good. You don't think so? I'm happy for her. Mom should—well, it can just be a small wedding, right?”
        
        When she advances a step randomly, she hears a familiar crunch and looks down, stepping back to see an even more familiar flattened silhouette, though despite the dim lighting, it still manages to twitch, so she steps on it again. She blinks, realizing she missed something in the conversation. “Uh, Molly. Molly, sorry, can you say that again? What did you just? I was distracted. No, I was just. I just remembered I have to clean out some things from my fridge, you know. Yeah, I. Yeah.”
        
        Angela stops again, looking between the light coming from the crevices of the outer doors and to the outside beyond the paneless window, where another crippled building stands casting a shadow. She does not smile. Her eyes are cold and blank as she takes in the dimming light of sunset. When she returns to listening, she does not attempt to pick up the conversation again. As Molly goes on, she remains silent, grabbing bits and pieces, figuring out what the other woman likely said while she was tuned out, and she keeps listening.
        
        “What?” She jerks her head, and hears Molly's concern. “No, I. I'm just distracted is all, no—no, I'm fine. Really, I promise. I'm fine.”
        
        She closes her eyes and rubs her forehead, frowning. When she opens her eyes, she looks pained as she stares at nothing in particular.
        
        “I can't. No, I can't.”
        
        She swallows, her mouth feeling dry as she looks about, only hearing every other word from the other woman as she starts to smile bitterly.
        
        “I wish. I wish I could be there, I really do. But I can't. Tell mom—yeah, you'll have to tell mom…”
        
        Molly says other things and Angela hangs her head. Changing direction, she slides open the outer door, not caring for the shriek of the metal or the sudden wave of fumes, but light streams into the room and through the bars of the washroom window, she sees the sky converging on the sun hidden by the trees and hills. She leans on the wall, staring, only partially bothered by the smell of the hole in the ground right in front of her. Right then, her eyes catch on the shower head on the wall, connected to a water heater a little taller than her against the wall. She has never used it.
        
        “I heard you.” She spins around and surveys her room. “Yeah. Maybe. We'll have to see, okay—I think I might be asleep then, and you know I have to wake up early, I. Sorry, I know, but. Yeah, I know.”
        
        Angela wipes at her brows, feeling the sweat dripping on her forehead. She does a quick look about and locates a rag dangling out of her laundry bucket. As Molly continues rambling in her ear, she grabs the rag and wipes at her forehead, dips in her shirt, front and back, and sighs under her breath as she throws it back into the bucket.
        
        “Yeah. Okay.” She nods to herself, to Molly, she was no longer sure. “Okay, I. Yeah, I can. I think. Yeah.”
        
        She holds up her head and waits, listening to Molly, her attention waning. Right as she swallows thickly, she hears Molly start to say goodbye. She smiles, unexpected relief washing over her as she nods again.
        
        “Okay. Bye. Yeah. Bye—I will, I'm sure, I will, okay? Bye. Yeah. Love you too. Bye.”
        
        Then there is the click and Angela draws the phone away from her ear. She stands, breathing deeply, unfocused. Gently closing her eyes, she attempts to focus on her beating heart and shaky breaths, but instead of calming down, she feels her whole body stiffen, shaking. Her eyes blink, unfocused, and she sucks in a breath to stop herself, only to close her mouth, setting her jaw.
        
        Her eyes dart over the room: the half-finished counter with a bucket and faucet for a sink, the bars on the open window looking out over the shadow-cast side of another abandoned building, the stone walls with splotches of paint and twisting cracks, the sheets and pillows on the floor that she called a bed, and the scurrying silhouettes of roaches. She dared not turn around, able to picture the hole in the ground, the rubble, the showerhead, and the barred window overlooking the sunset. The smell alone made the imagery vivid, chiseled into the cavern of her mind. Angela opened her eyes, not wanting to see the room surrounding her. She felt like crying, and she would have cried, but she was done.
        
        If only she could run, she thought, if only she could leave, and she fell to her knees, a silent scream echoing in her head, and she wanted to scream with all her might, but she dared not scream. With a rush of adrenaline, she blindly rose to her feet, and latched onto the bucket of used clothing, dumping it at her duffel bag. She hurriedly got down, unzipping it, and stuffed as much of the scattered clothing as she could reach, too frantic to care, and yet caring so much that she did not leave a thing behind. Whether or not she had it all, she surged up, rushing to the kitchenette, where she grabbed the bottles, the towel, even the dipper, and ran to stuff them in the duffel bag, and on her knees, she saw some articles she missed, swiftly picking them up and forcing them in.
        
        Angela stood, heaving the bag over her shoulder and made her way to the door, not forgetting to snatch her purse from the wall. She tore through the locks, a strange feeling of desperation and wicked happy anticipation pervading her with each click that signaled another lock undone, and swinging the door wide open, she felt free. With a growing smile on her face, she left, and behind her, the empty room grew dark.`

She is not beautiful, not by my usual definition, but then, my usual definition is subject to bias favoring nature and human expression. Perhaps then, she is beautiful and I cannot fathom that I have actually found a subject I find enchanting so-to-speak.

        The way the light caught in her eyes. A white square appeared in the corner of murky brown irises and glowed. With her features that seem to slope like mountains and slant like the strokes of Chinese characters, she gained a surreal air… The woman's face was long, drawn down into the jaw that was heavy and reminiscent of a horse. Raven black hair fell down the sides of her face and shoulders, swishing as the bus jerked, and as she watched the outside, light flared in her murky brown irises. At first, she seemed to be squinting, her eyes with their long downy lashes appearing near slits, but as she raised her chin, the squares of light appeared, illuminating the brown irises.`

As animated as she was, she seemed to laugh with the wholehearted guts of flirtation. The bridge of her nose and the slant of her forehead are both flat as if she has worn a Spartan helmet pounded against her skull. From the side, her constant ramblings of the forward, fumbling language of Spanish, or so it sounds from her lips, the strain of attraction, and her odd features capture my attention in such a way that I am more intent on eavesdropping when they utter foreign phrases than if they conversed in my native tongue.

        How odd. The very sound of her laughter and gasps are so much that of strained flirtation, I am compelled to wonder how real she is, both in her attraction and the fact that she exists less than a few meters away...`

The gold does not glimmer, yet it is bright and I wonder if it's dull and polished because the rings are not old-looking…

        I was just thinking I need a men's bag, then I looked up and saw a lithe man in a comfortable pair of blue jeans, a gray-and-blue streaked shirt, and a beige backpack featuring flowers, a girl, and sheep in thin pastel lines. The straps, back, and handles are a light brown, a very warm, almost golden, hue of the typical brown sold in stores. If that was his bag, I guess I needed simply a backpack, or a laptop case with a strap.`

It was admirable and reminded me of some movie, though it tends to be common here, though usually in some corner. These two stood right at the door.

        I found it interesting and with the tightness of surrounding bodies, I was made to look at this guy, and for the most part, I did try to look away, but there's only so much I can do if wanting to see something clearly requires craning my neck, so I looked at him.
        
        The guy had coarse, scraggly hair combed forward. His face was broad and flat, his lips large, the kind for sloppy wet kisses, which I find fairly disgusting, and his nose was flat apart from a small lump on its crooked length and flaring nostrils. In a certain light, he could be attractive, but his appeal would be selective.
        
        As for the young woman he held in his arms. She was as slim and thin as most young women here seem to be. She had straight bangs and two braids falling down her back. Her shirt had a round collar, exposing the curve of her neck. Apart from how her jaw moved and it seemed she was whispering and her boyfriend had the most unwelcoming expression of sheer indifference while holding her close, this is all I saw.
        
        Odd couple. It's heartwarming, I would think, but I just found them interesting. I feel, though, that others would find them, in a sense, heartwarming.`

I do not know if the stones were turquoise, purple, or black, yet the woman presented her hand beneath the camera of her mobile phone, resting it lightly in her boyfriend's as if brandishing an engagement ring. Perhaps it was a promise ring, though it rested on her middle finger. Over her boyfriend's hand which came up in the picture as if to grab a giant pearl in his grasp, it looked like a monster stretching forth its red-skinned claw to seize her. His hand was so red, that the redness could either be mistaken for overheating or a blush reaching from head to toe. What a strange thing to see…

        Pleasantries exist for people to say something in an otherwise awkward situation. Yesterday, I saw a woman lounging in a red velvet chair and a short time later, I found a second woman had sat down and proceeded to nap as well. It occurred to me that they could be strangers. What if it was normal to nap in public and wake up with a stranger opposite of you as if they are your company, or have become your company upon the two of you waking?
        
        The two stir…
        "[Good waking]. How was your nap?" 
        "Good, and yours?" 
        "Good."

        text: `A little girl with a very long plump face is crying here on the subway train. Her cries sound like gritty, heaved groans. When first everyone barged into the car and scrambled to secure a seat, this girl and her mother soon followed, easily walking in and stepping up to the bench because most everyone will give up a seat to a child here in China. It has been 5 minutes and the child continues to wail. It's not that hard to ignore, but what intrigued me was when she first started crying as if she were devastated greatly by something. She was directing her cries at her mother, making them more poignant and disruptive. Her mother was unfazed. She watched her little girl cry and after three heaving sobs that garnered no results, the girl wiped her own tears. Turning away, she persisted in crying, but the sound was not as gritting on the ear. She was crying to herself.

        Another interesting thing happened less than a few minutes ago. As the girl consented to sitting on her mom's lap and started to calm down, the doors soon opened to the next station. An old man of crinkled appearance, snaggle-toothed, worn, sun-burnt and freckled and moled, he stopped at me first. I thought he waited on me to give up my seat, but then he looked away and I saw his gaze was directed more towards the side of the bench with the girl and mother. He approached them and offered the girl a folded, previously rolled newspaper. She took it and calmed down from then on.

        text: `Two things today. I work in Taihe, about an hour from the city center by metro and an additional 20 min by motorbike. While I could go by bus from that stop, that takes longer and riding the motorbike is my guilty little pleasure. So much so that I have a small handful of drivers who recognize me on sight, such that I need only walk
        up to them and hop on the bike, instructions not required. This is only true in the morning though. For the trip back, I have always ridden with whichever driver is available, yet for the first time, today, as I climbed onto the back of a
        motorbike, another came up to me. The driver looked at me and seemed familiar with me. I could not recognize him, but he whispered to me. I felt like a woman caught by her boyfriend going out with another man. Awkward. And since that was so not the case, so terribly weird, then funny.
        
        I'll have to see next week if he's there again. Hope he's not the driver who takes the long ass detour. That would be awkward indefinitely.
        
        Number two. While on the way to the metro station, we passed a boy on a bike heading the other way. I thought he had a bag in front of him, dangling over the handle bars but it was another boy, one I figured was a little smaller since it seemed impossible with two boys of the same size. Somehow, I felt very self satisfied when I affirmed this idea at that time. But here's what really caught my attention.
        
        The other boy draped over the handle bars hid his head in the way a sick person does. Split second impression, unwell, whereas behind him, the boy driving the bike was all smiles. He was looking around in a daze, apparently amazed by something as if admiring fireflies hovering about him. As I thought about them, I figured the other boy was just sleeping, but what an idea to be driving someone unwell and looking about in wonder.
        
        Wish I had a story to put these things in.`

        text: `As I sat on the subway, waiting for my stop to arrive, I looked down and saw a dainty pair of feet. The skin was dark and frail with age, an aspect I hadn't noticed at first. Instead what I saw was the floral strap reminiscent of pink sakura blossoms and the pristine nails, the cream straps encircling a dainty ankle, and how small the foot was, poised on the curve of the tan wedge supporting it. However, as I followed the lines of the foot into the leg and noticed the protruding girth beneath a white and red-floral dress, I recognized a stereotypical dichotomy between the woman's body and the point of her feet. Later, once I was standing, I noted her flat, duck lips and her downcast eyes, the round face, and her brittle black hair combed and curled about her head. How strangely she matched.

        But that is a later moment. After noticing her feet and unusual structure, the doors of the train opened and in flooded more passengers. Among them, I glimpsed a cotton dress of wide horizontal stripes in pink, orange, and white. In that first glimpse, I saw the darkened skin of a young teen exposed in the shoulder and curve of a neck, and recognized the thin, scrawny body of one no older than twelve or thirteen. The age escapes me, once I noticed the height and lack of chest in the subject. It seemed like a boy, then I considered that it might be a girl. I strove to catch a glimpse of this new subject's face. In my pursuit, I met the warm black eyes of their mother.
        
        She was a tall woman, her refinement apparent in the loose floral folds of her shirt, her jeans, and the yellow short-heeled sandals appearing a simple complement. Such simple and adequate taste was rare to me. And when we gazed at one another, for the briefest of moments, it seemed she understood me and what I was trying to do. There was no judgment in either of us. I smiled for her son beguiled me. In fact, I affirmed to myself that her child was a boy once I finally stood. Previously, I had watched the boy swing from his mother's side and the outline of his face had both a masculine and feminine quality. But at last, while standing and after positioning myself to get through the crowd and doors at the next stop, I saw clearly the boy's face. Still, he could pass for a girl with his fanning lashes and almond-shaped black eyes. His hair was short, shaved near the nape and bounced about atop his head. The angle of his jaw was straight and his chin pointed with a dull tip. His lips were flat and sweet, and his smile was lovely.
        
        I was aware he could still be a she for his features were soft. But I told myself, I insisted, and by this insistence I must be strange, I needed him to be a he. Maybe it was because of how happy and innocent he seemed. Maybe it was how conditioned boys are in the US to be "boyish". Maybe it was my need to see people open and accepted. I was filled with happiness and pride when I saw him, and accordingly fixated on him.
        
        Whether he is a boy or girl though, such a fact I cannot confirm for that would be rude and I dare not offend, which means I must keep a delusional fancy, if that be truly what it is. I don't like such things. My only explanation can be a distaste for the imagination despite the active nature of my own.`

        I was standing on the edge of the crosswalk, waiting for the light to turn, I noticed a pair of women in white and pink. From their shoulders to the hem of the dress and the skirt, their clothes were infested with holes as if someone had embroidered a screen and then removed the screen. All white and all pink.
        
        It was two of the kinds of apparel where the knitting patterns speak for themselves. At a glance, I saw them and dismissed them, but my attention soon returned to them, wondering why they were interesting to me as they searched the street and spared glances at the building behind me. Then I noticed the face of the woman in pink and the only way I could describe her was as if someone had flat-ironed the top of her face. Beneath her thick, penciled brows, her eyes were flat and wide, exaggerated by shades of blue and silver (I'm guessing) and so were her cheekbones, but then her nose ballooned out, as did the flare of her cheeks and jaw, rising over the rolled flatness. Even her brows jutted out and her forehead sloped. Only her eyes and cheekbones were so flat that I imagined someone taking an iron to her face years ago and pressing hard with the heated steel, and I was so convinced by my own notion of her flatness that for a moment, I was genuinely searching for the burn marks such an injury would have surely left.
        
        There was none of course, and I want to say I feel bad. I feel awful because one should never perceive another's face the way I did. But with all I've thought and written before, it's really too late to become polite about it.`

        My footsteps fade behind as I wander, aware I've chased another apparition to nowhere. I can't understand it, seriously, how I see a man--I'm sure it's only one, though his colors may change. He always has the same broad shoulders, a long butterfly back, his head long like a living Adonis with curled hair and flat cheeks, a matted forehead, and thick straight brows. His eyes always appear clouded, yet his whole countenance fixates on me. No matter how or where I move, his eyes will follow, so I know how he watches.
        Most often, he will stand in shadows or just beyond the treeline, staring after me. Sometimes, his hair looks as blue as cerulean or black with tufts of gray and white. Once, his hair was the color of honey and shined under stray beams of light. Like his hair, his clothes will also change. I once saw a fur shawl draped over his shoulders, a gold-embroidered cloak hanging off one shoulder, a snow white suit, and even black armor.
        
        Every time, when I see him, the moment I seek to meet him, he turns and recedes from sight. No matter that I know he will already be gone, I am compelled to follow after him, where I am greeted by nature, beautiful, and consoling as I mourn him.
        
        There's a crunch behind me.
        
        When I peer back, I find him entering the glade, one of his gloved hands fisted at his side as he advances. He is a man of little height with a high hairline, his cheeks and forehead sagging despite being only forty, give or take a year. There's a light dusting of strangely blond hair over his upper lip and along his jaw. Last I remember, he possessed a unique charm, but it was not his age that repelled me. It was the abnormality of his dark eyes. There is a sharpness to his gaze, so out of place in the cordial, dumb masque of his face, such that I felt chills thinking of him. In his company, I was drawn to his humble, stately manner and whatever topic he deemed favorable for the weather, but once out of his company, I was disturbed, uneasy, even terrified.`

        Anyways, I don't know anything about any god, but there was a light, I think. My body grew cold, wasn't sure if I was dead or alive until I stood over my body. That was obvious. Then I left. Looked like a bunch of bad guys were collecting my body out of the pit. Inconspicuous and familiar-looking the lot. They didn't matter though.
        
        I drifted up and found the woman I died for. She screamed, covered her mouth. What a pale, human hand she had. More human than anyone I had ever seen. She trembled and seemed pale enough to die and follow me, but if she died, she'd probably die for real. Before I could warn her not to, she walked away from me. I walked after her. Funny how that worked. She excused herself from work. Then she was out and I followed into a car with her rocking on her chair, whispering to herself I wasn't there. She probably had no idea I was a ghost.
        
        "Fuck me," she muttered. I didn't think that possible.
        
        With her rocking and muttering to herself and ignoring me, I passed the time staring at my shoes. Strangest thing was sticking my hand in the astral pockets of my jacket, which disappeared cause I bet those men took it. Another strange thing was seeing my shoes, torn up and caked from the artificial mud my friends and I trampled in yesterday. Couldn't clean them, but next second I lost them anyway. Somewhere, wherever those guys took my body, they were stripping me. Hoped they didn't do anything to my corpse. Always hated that word. Corpse. Just like dead, morgue, mortician, autopsy. Dead stuff.
        
        "Onno?"
        
        She knew my name! Figures, since she called herself my stalker, but glad she's using it. She was facing me, duck lipped. That was mean, at least I didn't say it, but then she started crying and well, nothing. She sobbed and whispered my name with every sob and sniffle. For a second I thought of rummaging around her purse, except I wasn't sure at which point a ghost can start moving things around. I couldn't touch her, rub her back, or even give her a tissue. The first thing that came to mind was "I died to be with you," which I said aloud.
        
        She froze, not even moving. She stared at me in horror. Then she was smiling and it felt like I'd done something good, except I wasn't really feeling anything. There was just this weird sense of something in the air, something like me and I was guessing it felt like I was proud. I guess.
        
        The woman turned, yet kept her attention on me, even snuck a glance at me. Seemed she wanted me to say something.
        
        "Do you know me," she asked.
        
        I could ask the same thing. Actually it's a good thing I kept my mouth shut this time. This whole thing escalated too fast. Now, I'm dead and before even learning this woman's name, I died for her. This isn't funny, but last I checked, at least get a name and number before dying. It's like chivalry, only worse.
        
        "Onno."
        
        I stilled with her voice and found her standing outside the car. She looked at me, urged me to come out quickly, and I followed her. Looking around, she led me on through the station. The lights were weird. Really weird. I couldn't explain it, but the light was weird. Like it was alive and winking at me.
        
        "Pax!"
        
        I stopped. I looked around and there was no woman. Well, not the woman. There were women, a lot of them, but none of them were her. I found her behind me, far behind me. She was hugging herself, glaring at me as she caught up to me. Weak woman. She panted after such a small jog, but she seemed disappointed. "Why?"
        
        She looked to me. "Why what?"
        
        "You look disappointed."
        
        "You," she shook her head, glaring at me sideways. "You walked right through me. You gave me chills, damn you!"
        
        I felt her voice like a wave striking my shoulders. It tickled.
        
        "And now," she whispered, "you're making me look like a fucking lunatic."
        
        I tried brushing away the sensation, but it was like I was rippling. Maybe because I wasn't solid anymore. "I'm listening."
        
        She frowned and crossed her arms. "Really," she said, "Then what did I just say?"
        
        I looked at her. Her face was cold, unimpressed. No point in lying. "I wasn't listening." But she was cute.
        
        She closed her eyes and clenched her jaw. Then she walked through me, stopping with a shiver and groan. "So creepy," she muttered. I wanted to say that too, but she started walking away before I could echo her. I could echo her. Ghost echo.
        
        What a weird woman. Moments before I died, she apologized for stalking me and watching me every time I visited my dad, but I never noticed her. I never knew she was following me, not once. It seemed almost flattering, an older woman following me to school, following me to my dad's work, following me here and there. Her face was kind of plain, but she was fine by me. A little on the creepy side, her hair reminded me of those scary antagonists from horror films. I'm a ghost, but even those portrayals of my kind scare me.
        
        She stopped, standing in the mouth of a long, busy hallway. Turning her head, she peered over her shoulder. Glaring. "Damn you, Pax." Pivoting around, she stepped aside, way out of the streams of people, and crossed her arms, still glaring. Her eyes were really dark. The eye bags, shaggy bangs, if I just happened by her, I would have thought she wasn't very nice. Suddenly, she threw up her hands, made a loud huff, and spun away, made two stomps before stopping, dropping down to her haunches. My body was lifting, I was thinking of flying, cause there was no way I could approach like an ordinary person. She didn't have claws, but I could imagine her suddenly growing some, and scratching me? That's weird.
        
        I dropped down beside her. She looked everywhere else like she was genuinely looking for something. When she found nothing, she sighed and her head dropped.
        
        "Onno." It was weird hearing that name, felt like talking to one of my dad's friends. "Why don't you."
        
        "Call me Pax. Just Pax."
        
        She stared at me and it wasn't reassuring. With a deep breath, her eyes lifted upward. "I think," she said slowly, "I don't want to call you anything."
        
        My feelings were an echo. If I was alive, I'm sure I would have felt it, like a pang in the chest or a wrench in my gut. Without either of those, it was a thought. A thought that she shouldn't have said that. So, I wondered, what a ghost would do. "You wanted me to die." She watched me. Felt as if I should be nervous. Maybe. But I don't think I was feeling anything anymore, like I was fading altogether. "You said you wanted to love me."
        
        She nodded.
        
        "But you wouldn't. Couldn't. If I was alive."
        
        She looked away. She sighed and her shoulders fell. Bowing her head, her eyes closed. The shadows were darker on her face. I waved my hand over my eyes and realized everything was sort of darker. Her colors were fading, everything was fading as I was, changing like impressions in the dark with flashes cutting through a jet black sky.
        
        "You don't know me. Pax."
        
        I looked at her. Even now, I still didn't know her name, but as she turned her head and faced me, her eyes were narrowed and wet, her lashes beating furiously. Her lashes were black blurs. She had no color in her skin. That, or I was only seeing the light, the shadows, and hints of colors like splatters on a canvas. I traced her jaw until she flinched back from me, but I did it again because the fine shadows of her hair were distorting her face, her colorless face with light disseminating her features.
        
        "Pax," she cried. I stopped. She shook her head before tearing her gaze away and staring at the floor. Just hanging her head, breathing in and out, I could count her every breath, even see it disturbing the air. The noise of it was like a gust of wind, only to stop like dispelled smoke and drifting out like a perfume. When it reached me, I shivered. Her heat was overwhelming. Crap. She was talking.
        
        She stood, hands clenched, and I thought she was going to leave me, but she didn't move. Her limbs were shaking. Slowly, she lowered herself again, back down to her haunches, the way she'd been before. When she sighed, I practically flew away, or dissolved. My body, or whatever I was becoming, was reeling and rippling.
        
        Her silence was disturbing. There were sparks in the air like restlessness without the legs to feel them. I checked that I still had legs. Even if I was a ghost. Looking to the woman and her black and white face, the shadows so dark and the light so bright that she had no nose or a second eye, I leaned towards her and asked "So what's your name?"
        
        She turned her gaze towards me, eyes wide and her mouth agape. I said it wrong, I guess.
        
        "Onno." She said something. I wasn't listening. This was getting weird, but this time, she held her head in her hand and smiled at me. "My name's Jessia," she whispered.
        
        "Good to know."
        
        But I'm a ghost now. She said she could only love me if I were dead, but how was she supposed to love me now?
        
        Now that I'm fading.`

        text: `Today, I was thinking of a love story based strongly on King Arthur. To be honest though, I am not too familiar with the folklore and all its variations. Instead, what I saw was the dry, grassy hills of England as often depicted in such movies and there was the legend of Excalibur, the sword in the stone that not even the strongest man could extract, but then a young, simple-looking man appeared after years of failed attempts and resentful, crass denouncements of the sword's merit...
        
        This simple young man approached the sword and its stone with no true intention of freeing the legend. At the legend's implications, he fell to his knees. He wished for peace and unity among the peoples who labored and grieved and pined over the most minuscule of scraps. He prayed to the heavens, to the sword in the stone that it was so strong and honorable as to provide such a state of peace. Out of plain anguish, his misery clinging to the last of hope, he reached for the sword's thorn-lain hilt and even as the thorns pierced his hands, he grasped the legend's hilt and pulled. Without his notice, as he poured all his hopes and prayers into his one and only effort, the spirit of the sword, a small and fragile-looking woman, appeared. The sword slid smoothly out of the stone. The spirit watched as the young man stumbled back, never worried that her sharp edge would harm him. Dumbfounded, the man marveled at the sword, only to notice her and marveled at her soft beauty and shadow-like smile.

        Without a word, for she could not speak, she approached him, touching his chest where his heart raced and looked him in the eyes, pulling him to cradle the hilt in his hands. She chose him.

        From then on, the spirit of the sword trained the young man to wield her. Unbeknownst to him, she was teaching him not only how to fight, but how to kill. Because the legendary sword was so thin and small, when others found that it was this simple, young man that had managed to release it, they mocked him and the sword, once more calling it worthless. But when the taunts became malicious and a former rival arrived at the young man's training ground, the young man lost his patience. He accepted his rival's challenge.

        All throughout their duel, the spirit of the sword guided him and coerced him forward in the deadly dance, and against his will, she drove his hand and her blade to pierce straight through his rival's chest, coating the blade and his hands in blood. Horrified, his rival's friends ran away, while at the sight of his murdered rival, the young man backed away, dropping the sword, denying his ownership and abandoning it at the feet of the fallen. In despair, the spirit of the sword watched him questioning himself. Realizing that he might return her to the stone, she lamented choosing him, but when he saw her sorrow, he attacked her with his rage and guilt. He threatened to return her to the stone, crying he could never wield a sword that kills.

        At such ridiculous words, the spirit of the sword retaliated. With the blood on her from his fallen rival, she revived the man, and the man stood as the dead, challenging the young man. Despite the young man's adamant refusals, the dead man attacked. The spirit of the sword raised up hundreds of swords that were buried and forgotten in the history of the soil, allowing him to choose from their number, but when he reached for hers, she swatted his hand away, rejecting him.

        The young man tried numerous other swords, but not only had he never trained with them, some were brittle, some were too heavy, and some slipped from his shaky hands. In the midst of his struggle, he failed to notice the villagers arriving to witness his duel with the dead. With one sword, he managed to decapitate the dead. Though he cried over the brutality of his win, the people cheered and the dead rose again. Desperate, with the same will and prayer that had called the spirit of the sword out of the stone, the young man took her sword, crying at her, begging her to let the man rest in peace. He took her sword and struck the dead man down. Answering his wish, the dead man stilled. Everyone waited. When the dead man no longer rose, the people cheered, whereas the young man turned to the spirit of the sword and begged her never again to take or use another life unless it was necessary for the peace and welfare of his people. She stared back at him, studying his earnest, almost pitiful face, but then nodded. He'd learned his lesson, though he hadn't realized it.

        Thereafter, the young man's reputation spread throughout the land and challengers came. The young man conducted himself like a king, his confidence growing as he saw his people meeting others and sharing food, water, and cloth. The various tribes of the land began joining together. Sometimes, the young man had to fight and with the guidance of the sword, he always won. However, over time, as he committed and devoted himself to the people, they noticed an abnormality in his behavior. He talked to himself, seemed to always be looking towards something they could not see, and his jealousy and possessiveness over his sword overtook him rather suddenly at times. The women he slept with told others of being loved by him, only to find him leaving them in the middle of the night to sit, cradling his sword, with which he would sleep.

        Of two favored lovers, one fair-haired and the other raven-haired, on one of the nights he visited, the raven-haired beauty woke and sought him out. She found him cradled around his sword as usual and called to him. He did not stir, but suddenly, the spirit of the sword became visible to her and she saw the spirit wrapping her arms around him, holding him possessively. The raven-haired beauty fled to inform the men, claiming the young man wielded a demon sword, that a ghost held him captive. Meanwhile, the spirit of the sword woke the man. She showed him the empty bed and pointed outside the door, where the woman had disappeared. With understanding, the man sheathed the sword and fled with her out the window. When the raven-haired beauty returned with the men, they found the room empty. She was shamed and mocked in their wake. Angered, she swore her revenge, running to his enemies and promising them his secrets.

        ...[awfully dramatic]

        In my mind, this was the break of a play and then the beginning of Act II. At the start of the second act, one sees that the young man has been acknowledged as King among the united factions. Among his subjects, the fair-haired beauty he favored is still with him and is seen as likely to become his queen. He lives in a castle with his knights, overseeing the lands and people who have come together under his rule. However, the King's enemies have all banded together to wage war against him and his budding kingdom.

        At this point, it occurs to me that there should be something with zombies or the undead as well…

        In one last stance, the new King gathered his knights and men for their last stand. They met their enemy on the battlefield, but were forced to retreat, when it became clear they were steadfastly losing.

        With shame and guilt, the King found comfort in his fair-haired beauty, even setting aside his sword for the night. Later that night, as one might expect, the enemy infiltrated the King's castle. The ringleaders located the King and seized the room. They captured his fair-haired beauty and the legendary sword. Without the sword, though the King could fight better than he did when he first encountered her, there were too many men against him, forcing him back and down. Soon enough, it became clear that he would die. He was fatally injured and fell to his knees. Without a shred of hope, he bowed his head in shame, prepared for his death.

        Seeing him fallen, the spirit of the sword flared to life. She materialized before the enemy could congratulate or rejoice and took the hilt of her own sword, slashing down all the men and traitors in the room. In the light of the moon, in a sea of red, she slaughtered all those that would oppose the King. Then she approached him. As he took hold of her, she healed him with all the blood taken, reminiscent of her power to raise the dead. Standing once more, the King held tight to his sword and rallied his knights, taking back the castle, effectively ridding themselves of the enemy's threat. With the rising of the sun, the King and his men witnessed the volume of their victory. They rejoiced.

        And when the fair-haired beauty emerged, the people cheered for her, hailing her as Queen. Without protest, the King approached her, took her hand, and led her to the crowds, presenting her as his bride.

        However, the scene of carnage in the fair-haired beauty's bedroom remained with the King. With a heavy heart, he quieted the celebrations. He honored his men, his sword and its legend, and the peace that the people never thought possible. Then he led the people back to the stone where the sword had once rested. In celebration of the kingdom's beginning and the expected era of peace to follow, the King returned his sword to the stone, declaring it a time of peace. Everyone cheered, all except for the King and the Queen-to-be. After the people parted, the spirit of the sword sat in their wake, understanding that it was time for her to rest, and even fade away.

        But no matter that even the King would not bring her back, there was someone who still believed in her. Unbeknownst to the King, the fair-haired beauty had witnessed the massacre in her bedroom. Even more than the wounded King, she saw the spirit of the sword cut down all his enemies. The blank face and surreal beauty of the sword's spirit were engraved in her memory, and unlike the King, despite the carnage, she could not see how the beauty and value of the sword were tainted. With her upcoming nuptials though, she felt guilt and grief. As the King's mood slowly waned and the preparations for the wedding were underway, the Queen-to-be felt she was committing a grave crime.

        In marrying the King, she was becoming a traitor to his kingdom.

        In recollection, she understood the abnormalities of the King, that he was merely friend and companion to the spirit of the sword as much as the sword's spirit was to him. All his love that allowed the kingdom to form and flourish came from the strength and dignity the sword gave him. After seeing the spirit's retaliation against his enemies, it was also clear no other would ever wield her. The sword would accept no one other than the King, and in that mutual devotion, the Queen-to-be's love seemed no more than a shade. But a man could not love a sword, nor a sword a man. Inanimate objects were not alive, they were meant to be used, except the Queen-to-be knew that was a lie, proven wrong the very night she witnessed the spirit's desperate fury. An object could not love, but spirits could.

        The night before the wedding, the Queen-to-be ventured to the sword in the stone. She knelt at the stone's base and in the light of her candle, she gazed at the thorns, moss, and the glimmering blade. As she waited, no spirit appeared before her. Disappointed, she stood and turned, but then stopped herself, dropping down before the stone one more time.

        "My lady," she pleaded softly, gazing at the sword in earnest. "I don't know what to do."

        She waited, hoping the spirit was listening, hoping it cared to listen. "I can't marry him, your master, knowing he belongs to you. He knows nothing of your love for him, but I saw it. I saw it and I cannot bear to wrong you, not after what you have done for us." Her eyes searched the moonlit blade, the hilt, the thorns. "It is you who brought the knights together, it is you who spurred the King from his lowly village and made him a King. I heard him," she assured, on the verge of tears when it seemed no one heard her. "And like them, I thought he was odd, but now I know that it was you he held at night and you he looked to for council and confidence. You are his strength. And he is withering without you." Just as the sword was, she acknowledged, staring at the dulling blade and rigid straps of the hilt. "If you can hear me, please, please show yourself to me."

        But there was no answer. Defeated, the Queen-to-be stood. She gazed down at the sword, yet just as she turned, the spirit of the sword materialized, wrapped around the sword, sitting defeated on the stone. She gazed after the fair-haired beauty who seemed to sense the shift in the air. Turning back to her, the Queen-to-be gasped in horror, seeing the neglect all across the spirit's facade. Seeing the thorny vines, dull complexion, and dark gaunt eyes, the Queen-to-be fell to her knees, crying. She lifted her head and reached for the poor spirit who did not flinch from her hand. To her surprise, she touched the cool skin of the spirit as if there were an actual woman in front of her.

        "How could we have done this," the Queen-to-be wondered.

        The spirit stared at her. Then the Queen-to-be made a decision. With resolution, she gazed back at the spirit and whispered "You saved the King, me, this kingdom." The spirit acknowledged with no more than a dull stare. "Please, I will make things right. We will save you."

        There was no answer, no sign of acknowledgment, but gazing into the dark eyes of the spirit, the Queen-to-be found her resolve. Those dark eyes would burn once more, she swore it to herself and the spirit. She bowed her head, then climbed to her feet and hurried away.

        Back in the castle, the Queen-to-be stirred her ladies-in-waiting and in their groggy state, she described to them an urgent task. Her women were confused, questioning her, though with her station, they dared not disobey her. As they reached full consciousness, they processed her request. The lot were very confused, but with them, the Queen-to-be insisted on accompanying them. Uncertain, yet seeing their lady's determination, the women collected themselves. Right before they left though, the Queen-to-be stole away for a moment, bearing something none of her ladies-in-waiting had seen her take. Then without notice, the Queen-to-be and her ladies-in-waiting snuck out of the castle unnoticed, making their way to the sword in the stone.

        In the hours of the early morning, the women returned as sneakily as they had left.

        Then first thing in the morning, when everyone was awake, the Queen-to-be presented an unusual request to her company. All were gathered for the wedding, which was to take place soon, yet was stalled, waiting for the Queen-to-be to dress, as well as for the Queen's coronet to be found. At first, the Queen-to-be had her request denied by the knights. Her ladies-in-waiting insisted that there was no merit to it and worried about where her coronet had gone. She wondered why the coronet mattered, since there had not been a queen before anyway, but her women and the knights told her it was a matter of being acknowledged as the King's wife. The Queen-to-be kept her silence.

        After she was dressed and walked down the steps to join the King, she stopped the wedding with such force that everyone stood stunned. Her ladies-in-waiting were so shocked, they stopped fussing about the missing coronet. If anyone else had cried out during their own wedding as she had, people would have whispered of the bride's madness and expressed pity for her partner. But as the Queen-to-be stood facing the King, before the people, the knights, and the bishop, no one would dare consider her mad or silly.

        The King stared into her determined gaze. He did not know anything of her unusual request as none of the knights had brought it to him, but admiring her spirit, he smiled and urged her to continue. For himself, he wondered what could have possibly spurred his timid-mannered fair-haired beauty to hold herself with such resolution and to speak with an authority only attributed to men.

        The Queen-to-be then spoke to the people, the knights, the bishop, and particularly the King, urging them that the wedding should take place before the stone, where the legendary sword lied in neglect. She reasoned that the sword was not just a symbol of war, it was peace and strength. It was the symbol of their unity, for because of it, the King united the people. Without any hesitation, the people supported her motive.

        The bishop had no qualms with moving the procession, agreeing with her sentiments, and deferred to the King who hesitated. Speaking formally, he argued that they have entered a time of peace, but a sword was a weapon and could only be used for war and conflict. His sword had no place in times of peace. To this, his knights agreed.

        Answering with equal calm, the Queen-to-be argued that it was as much an act of intent to withhold a sword as it was to wield it, but to cast it aside was to cast aside the responsibilities inherent in holding it, whether or not one used it. She allowed her words to sink in. Then in a more sympathetic tone, the Queen-to-be assured the King that whether used or not, the spirit of the sword would never fade. The King was left speechless, aware of her exact meaning, whereas for the people, they assumed she meant everything that the sword represented. The knights and the people all agreed.

        Taking the King's hand, the Queen-to-be urged all assembled to gather on the hill, where the sword and its stone stood. Silently, the King allowed her to guide him, ruminating on her words. He wondered how she even knew of the spirit.

        When they arrived, the King immediately noticed that the Queen's coronet had been lain over the sword's hilt. The ladies-in-waiting were quick to try and take it, but the Queen-to-be stopped them. Thinking fast, she explained that she had done it. It was a symbol. Hesitantly, her women accepted it.

        The bishop moved about the stone and made as if to step on it, only for the spirit of the sword to swat him away. Then the King finally noticed the rejuvenated spirit who was even more radiant than he remembered and she held the coronet in her hands. As the ceremony commenced, the Queen asked that the King once more hold his sword in honor of their new kingdom. Everyone conceded and without their knowing as the King took the sword back into his hands, the spirit moved to his side, laying her hands over his. The ceremony concluded with the King and Queen turning to the people, holding hands. But unseen by all except the two of them, the spirit of the stood in front of the King, held close to him by the sword and its coronet in his hand.

        The people dispelled, leaving the Queen and King alone on the hill. Once gone, the Queen addressed the spirit, bowing to her. Looking to the King for permission, she took the Queen's coronet and placed it on the head of the spirit, much to the King's surprise. Focused on the spirit, the Queen prayed that the spirit would guide the new Queen in being a fair and patient ruler. The spirit acknowledged her with a kiss. Then the Queen faced the King, smiling. She excused herself, leaving the King alone with the spirit of the sword.

        After the Queen left, the King lowered himself to his knees before the spirit of the sword and embraced her mortal form, promising her that he would never abandon her again, neither her nor her spirit. She accepted his embrace.`

        text: `The night was predetermined, its events and startling revelations decided like a strike of lightning, or rather as the sky split in half, the blues beautiful and rich, the darkness daunting and hanging over the black woods, it seemed my choice was made. Standing on the patio, I gazed up at the skies. Tendrils of the gray clouds invaded the blue, their white underbellies glowing as if behind them hid the moon, soon curling and rearing up, forming the dragons of lore. They spread over me, infecting the serene blue heavens as the sun set, and in their wake, one large gaping dragon remained, an eye piercing through his mist and in it, a single glowing pupil. I had no idea if he was blessing me or cursing me, but he was staring at me with that one good eye. As he disappeared past the roof, the wind changed and blew towards the black woods. How stupid you might think me. But here is what you don't know about me. Darkness has never been my enemy.

        With the wind guiding me, I crossed the dirt lane behind the houses and ran into the dark woods, the towering pines and shivering oaks quick to embrace me. In my wake, my house and the friendly neighborhood were no more. As I wandered on, I marveled at the shadows within shadows, caring little for the native residents and their chattering, hooting, or scampering.
        
        "Give it to me," I whispered to the trees.
        
        "Give it to me," I told the wind.
        
        I held out my arms and faced the sky. Smiling at the dark heavens, I chanted in my heart, "Give it to me." As soon as I blinked, I saw a flash, a minute vision of flickering flames, a warm room, where a large man sat in a giant armchair, overlooking the fireplace embedded in a face formed of books. It seemed so cliche, I did not realize my mistake. I did not notice the hungering mouth, where the flames danced with an eerie white light. Instead, I was too quick to switch it.
        
        Opening my eyes, finding myself on the edge of the black forest, I found a grove, where a mansion stood, daunting and forgotten. Hurriedly, I ran to its door, passing through it and rushing through its maze of halls and red oak doors. Such a silent home. But that mattered nothing. I would change that scene and sure enough, I located the giant man. Turning about, the first thing that came to mind was snow, and so, I casted the man into a draft. He and his chair then sat on the crest of a hill blanketed in snow. As I approached him, I intended to question him, to ask him who he was, until I noticed a young boy dressed in coat, hat and mittens coming up the hill.
        
        I conjured a creature from a preceding fantasy, my Babajo, a monkey with a crocodile head, and hugged him to me. Together, we watched the young bundled-up boy come up to the man and stare at him. The giant man said nothing, neither did he move. The boy removed a mitten, reaching into his pocket, pulling out something like a dumpling, which he offered to the man. Without answer, he stuffed himself and left. Soon, a young woman came. She dropped to her knees in the snow, at the feet of the giant man. Silently, she removed one of his shoes, the sock on his foot, and exposing his large foot to the cold, she began suckling on his toes.
        
        "Well, that's sick," I whispered to Babajo, but even as I said that, I started to smile. "Hey," I cried. The man did not respond. "Who are they?" He didn't answer, but he stood like an apparition departing his body where it sat. Behind him, it faded away as did the young woman. I followed him. Babajo leapt from my arms into the snow, so I held his hand as we ventured after the large man. Being a crocodile-headed monkey, Babajo could not make much of any feasible sound, so as I whispered on and on, he could not reply, yet neither did the man. I tried imagining it, except the man still refused. "Hey, where are?"
        
        The man rounded on me and told me to be silent. I wondered if he was an ice fisher, seeing that he was standing at the edge of an icy lake, but he walked on it, without any equipment. There was a hole in the ice. As he reached the hole, he stooped down. Watching him and peering through the hole, I saw glimmering fish swimming among the dark waters. It was gorgeous, though still a little obscured, and then the man was holding his hand above the hole. When he uncurled his fingers, a black powder fell into the waters. The fish died in mass.
        
        The man replaced the ice on the hole, then stood and brushed his hands together. I questioned him, but he never answered. Babajo and I chased him back, asking him why he killed the fish. Why. I replayed everything. I made it happen again and again because he refused to answer. Watching him stoop down beside the hole, reach into his pocket and bring his hand over it, drop the powder, and the death of the fish, he did it over and over without explanation. Then he was back in his chair. I cried at him to answer me. He glared back at me. He looked ahead of himself at the fire I had abandoned. Realizing my ignorance, I called back the mansion, called the walls and dark red carpets, gazed as the books re-materialized and only then did I notice the gaping mouth of flames.
        
        The man stood once more, striding out into the hall. I picked up Babajo and joined him. What an eerie silence pervaded the mansion. I heard coughing and shuffling. Then I saw through the doors at rooms with no wardrobes, chairs, or dressers. Instead, they were filled with cots. In those cots lay shadows of men and women, ailing children that tried to rise, but unseen illness shoved them back against the stained sheets.
        
        "You're a doctor." Instinctively, I hugged Babajo tighter against me as the three of us continued into a kitchen. There was a boiling pot and to that, the man added his black powder. He would kill all of his patients. The absurdity made me scream at him. With nonchalance, he brushed his hands off and strode past me. I questioned him over and over, "Why would you kill them? You're a doctor. You're supposed to heal them, not. Don't tell me these people are beyond help that you would. Heal them!"
        
        But he would not listen. He checked on the patients and one young woman wandering through the ward caught his attention. Crossing to her, he gently guided her away, past the kitchen, into a dust-laden cellar, empty apart from a wooden lid on the floor, which reminded me of the hole in the ice. Suddenly, the man opened the lid and threw the young woman down into a festering pit of bodies, people rotting while alive. They were zombies and not the movie-magic kind. These were real and desperate, clamoring to escape some monster eating them. He set the lid and left.
        
        For some odd reason, and I know my mind is questionable for wondering about this, I questioned him, crying louder, but he never acknowledged any of it. Stunned, I stumbled down beside the wooden lid and without thinking about it, I found myself lifting it open and gazing into the darkness with boiled arms and eaten faces crowding to reach me. What seemed like hundreds of bulging yellow eyes peered back at me. And when I looked to Babajo, he was becoming one of them. Something in the air was as rotten as the bodies below and before I could cry, I grabbed Babajo, throwing him down, and slammed down the lid. But at that moment, I couldn't cry. This was getting annoying, cause none of it was making sense. Good thing I love dark.
        
        I wanted to know, so I questioned the man, hovering about him and asking and asking, even allowing one of the zombies to crawl out. She was a frighteningly rotten kind of cute, then he got a rifle and blew half her head off. I really liked her then, fancying her as a second Babajo. This zombie with its brain mostly missing was Babajo 2.0, only she seemed to cling to me more.
        
        With Babajo 2.0 at my side, I watched the good Doctor, the large silent man who donned the traditional white lab coat, care for his patients. For some reason, in one of the cots, a girl took my notice. When I looked over her from where I stood, the Doctor lashed out at me. Laughing, I begged him to tell me who she was. Tell me, tell me, I cried, what fun. What happened next, I can hardly recall, but suddenly, I knew that she was dead. Lying in that cot, a girl's corpse was wrapped and while not forgotten, unmoved for weeks. So funny, I thought, so thrilling, and the demented Doctor chased me away from her. And then the man was advancing on me with an ax.
        
        No, I remember now. I remember just what I did to find out.
        
        After the Doctor yelled at me to stay away from her, when I hadn't yet approached her, I thought of going near her anyway, but a chill emerged and crept across my back. It was crawling like the fingers of the reaper tracing my spine. If the reaper could speak, that living skeleton was likely whispering dark prose of impending death as if teasing and enticing me. I had to admit, both the thought and feeling were tantalizing, except I preferred to avoid dying, so I refashioned my zombie and turned her into a pristine, cute young woman with blond locks and bright blue eyes, a doll of smooth flesh and pumping blood. Then I sent her over. Before she could even reach the dead girl's cot, the Doctor attacked her, chopping her furiously into a bloody mangled mess. And then he advanced on me.
        
        I scrambled away, screaming at him to stop. It wasn't me that got close to her, I didn't see, but then I couldn't help myself, I couldn't stop laughing and accusing him, reminding him of murder, death, and disease. What a good doctor, I taunted, you did that to her, didn't you. Yet as he raised his ax, suddenly I was staring into the shadows of the giant man's face and saw him crying. A face of absolute horror and anguish greeted me. How beautiful, I thought, and greater was his tormented beauty as he shook and wavered, daring not to strike me with the ax. At first, I taunted him, saying he cried but he killed, only for the scene moments ago to replay and I saw that he did not cry when he hacked my zombie apart. He was a cold and ruthless killer, yet he could not kill me, so I taunted him even more until it struck me. Before I knew it, I was crying at him that I am his devil. In defeat, he lowered his ax and left me. His resigned silence was an admission of the truth. Then I wondered how, why. Even if for me this was illusion, for him I was a devil that he wished to kill and yet, could not bear to in his taciturn heart, or maybe it was not as taciturn as I liked.
        
        Splitting from me came a true devil and it was this very devil he desired to kill. But I should mention, for now the details blur, the moments are compounded and I wonder how it all happened.
        
        Chasing after the man like the shade he saw me as, I tormented him with proclamations of his crime. I saw the dead girl with her face bashed in to the point that no one, not even a loving relative, might recognize her. Even if her body had decayed over the weeks that had passed, however many there were, no one could mistake the broken bones. How violently she was killed, and I knew the man was responsible. He had to be. Later, turned out it was, but how much more complicated were his motivations. When I demanded his reasons, when I plainly observed every mark of violence in her bones and ordered him to tell me his reasons, I saw his shame and remorse. How exhilarating this game, I thought, and "I," I declared, "I am your devil, being the devil's advocate that I am. Whoever knows what right and wrong are, here I could care less. I know I screamed, yes I screamed at you for your lack of humanity, but that was me, see how fickle I am. I will play devil's advocate and I say fuck her. Fuck that decomposed pile of bones and scrap." As if in a trance, he obeyed.
        
        I laughed and laughed, but I wondered who was the girl, and who was the devil that parted from me. The devil had black skin, the skin ridged and taut on their bone-thin arms. This devil was bald and had a spiked spine, curling in on itself. Her claws were long and large for her tiny body. She was likely the size of a preteen girl, if only she could unfurl her form.
        
        "Are you the devil," I wondered, "his devil?" She nodded to me, her manner casual as she sat with me and we crawled to the door to watch the demented Doctor side by side. "Who are you to him?"
        
        The way she looked at the man and the horror of what he was doing only then got to me, though not because it was morally wrong. Necrophilia was fun in certain context, but while questioning a devil, it was disturbing and mostly distracting, so I shielded my eyes, unintentionally crying at my devil companion. "You're his daughter. How did this happen?"
        
        The devil smiled at me. "I thought you enjoyed this." I shrugged, my hand still out to block the sight of the man fucking his daughter's corpse, because as I found from the devil, she said "That was me."
        
        "I get that I'm wrong," I said, "I never affirmed whether or not I had a conscience and honestly, I don't care to have one. In my world, what need have I to worry about the morality of crimes or the ethics of propriety. Being humane is always the last thing I consider, it's just a manner of fun. But this! Okay, this, I like necrophilia, pedophilia, they're rather juicy, and I realize I cried out for incest, but now I'm talking to you and that's just annoying."
        
        The devil chuckled. "It's not his fault."
        
        I lowered my hand and stared at the insane man's back as he fully pursued the action. "He desired her in life. Before she died."
        
        The devil tilted her head, smiling sadly, and never once turned away from the horrifying spectacle. "My mother was a devil," she stated, her voice soft and thoughtful, "and she donned a human disguise in order to love him. She had brown hair and black eyes." Similar to the man. He had eyes of brown and hair of black. "There was a human baby in her womb, but the baby was dying, so she called on a devil and that devil was me."
        
        I looked to the devil, seeing what she saw, the human-masked devil that birthed her and as I gazed at her, I realized that the woman loved her, even if she wasn't the human baby. A mother's love was strangely unconditional, especially for a devil, but then as I insisted on repeating to this devil, a number of times I feel unnecessary to note or recount, I insisted she was clearly not a western or Christian devil, so I was bound to an open understanding of her nature and character. Her mother was the same kind of devil as her, but this devil was not conceived by the body. She was summoned.
        
        "So what happened?"
        
        "I was born with blue eyes and blond hair."
        
        Then it made sense. He never believed her his daughter. With her foreign face, she could have easily belonged to a stranger and despite loving her, he could have always bore that suspicion. Worse yet, if he began to lust for or fall in love with his own child, no thought of incest would stop him.
        
        "He loved me," she insisted. I shifted my gaze to her and stared into her sincere black eyes, eyes that did not belong on a bald, black-skinned, spiked-backed devil. "When I was that girl, he did love me as a daughter."
        
        "So what happened? Cause I'm really trying to make sense of this. Looking at that body, you came from that, but there's no way to mistake what happened. Anyone could see. You don't need a scientist or detective or forensics in here to tell you that girl was beaten before her death, and here in my head. Here in this fucked up head, I see her raped by her own father."
        
        "It was killing him," she whispered, looking after him. The man was done. "We devils cannot last. The bodies we have or that we take, they begin decomposing from the inside."
        
        "Where's your mother?"
        
        She looked back. I followed her gaze and then we were seeing a flash of the cellar with the wooden lid, the hole, and a pit beneath the floor. The mother devil was the creature eating those people, keeping them alive and yet eating them whole. At last, I could see her with the same ridged black skin, the spiked curling spine, and the claws, but she was far taller, her proportions longer. As I reviewed the events in my head, the events leading one to another still made no sense.
        
        "What happened to her?"
        
        "Her shell started to crack and she." I saw the mother tear her human shell apart, yet not how she ended up down there, mindless and monstrous like that. Did it even matter, I wondered. My focus has all been on this girl, or rather the devil born in the girl and released weeks ago. Watching the devil, she gazed off into the distance. Following her gaze, the world about us morphed. We were watching scenes of reverie interlaced with memories, and in them, the doctor was indeed a very loving father. He had been a good man.
        
        However, the past was the past and I remembered the man hacking my zombie apart, dropping the poison in the soup, throwing another body down through the hole in the cellar, and concluded one thing. "He will never accept you."
        
        She nodded. We continued watching and I kept on thinking it over, wondering if there was ever a situation that he could. What interesting memories, beautiful and so picturesque that I became bored and confused, if that were possible.
        
        "Have you ever tried saying I'm your daughter?" She was silent. "Or calling him dad?"
        
        There was no answer. Her plain pitch eyes without eyelids, eyelashes, or eyebrows were fixated on him. Then the devil's words echoed in my head, that it was not his fault. Suddenly, another meaning struck me.
        
        I could see then that the man never had any ill intention. Most likely the devil beside me could not see it, for it was not the state of her reality that she could, but what he had done to her was neither done with malicious nor passionate intentions. He was innocent, which really made no sense. He beat his daughter in order to rape her, killing her in the process. There was no way that could be done innocently. I tried to figure out, looking for something I missed in any of the stream of memories, yet there was nothing. I sat there, puzzled. Amid watching a particular memory of the man and his daughter in the field, right around the particular age of the incident, and without a hint of the ill fate for the girl, I was left confounded, whereas while smiling softly, the devil beside me leaned towards me and laid herself down with her head on my lap. She fell asleep. Turning my attention back to the memory, I found that the scenery remained the same, but the man was now aware of us and staring at the devil. He gazed straight at me. His daughter reverted back to a young girl. Grinning, he picked her up, only for her to morph into the devil lying her head on my lap.
        
        Shocked, I urged the devil to wake up, but I started to cry and begged her to wake up. "You need to see this." She didn't respond though, being silent and motionless. The man and girl faded, leaving behind the man as I had seen him in the mansion. With the dark shadow over his face and his imposing figure, he advanced toward us. Despite knowing, I still urged the devil to wake. She did not. Instead, the man reached down, picking her up as if cradling her like a babe, then he turned away. "Why did you do it," I cried.
        
        For the first time, he stopped. Turning back to me, he answered. "So she could rest in peace."
        
        With that, he faded away, as did the field, the mansion, and the devils. I was left in the middle of the forest, a cold wind moaning, the dark giants fluttering their spiny fingers. My eyes were stinging, my sobs lost even to my own ears, and soon enough, I merely stood in the forest, thanking whichever deity or natural entity had listened. Give it to me, I had said. As soon as I felt well enough, I left.`

        text: `Recently, I have been edging away from realism, and for some reason, I have been, in a manner of speaking, trapped by it. While I have my current project, today I was thinking, only on the bus home though. In my head was black and white. Then I saw a city on a gray scale.

        The color scheme of the city was both a choice and a public expectation. People stayed in their lines and queues, moving at the same deliberate and measured pace that all others did. If there existed any color, it was hidden or foreign. In this city, a thin man strode through the crowd with his eyes down. He dressed in the same gray-scale as everyone else, but his silver hair was styled up and ruffled. It was not normal.
        
        To give him a name, which I have just made up, he was Petris Parnicle, a man of his early thirties completely disenchanted with life. The monotony of the city was so thick and repressing that he had accustomed himself to the sensation of suffocating. He was numb. After realizing there was no swimming against the current in this city of extraordinary uniformity, he surrendered to his life, but as one might suspect, in him rested an innate spark of hope, flickering and teetering on the brink of being snuffed out, and it would have, if not for one peculiar encounter with one Miss Juvius Straln, a woman whose age is practically indeterminable though one would suspect she was somewhere in her mid to late twenties.
        
        Pan urban street. Petris marches down the sidewalk with clear agitation in his step, only to pause and cock his head.
        
        He hears the clattering of cans, bottles, and the rustling of plastic sacks and discarded paper. When he looks over, he gazes down an alley, where he spots a figure fishing around in the trash. All he sees is the blue hair, long at the back, styled and short in the front, curtaining a foreign entity donning a massive beat-up brown jacket infested with holes, scratched, mauled, and sewn back together at angles both intentional and odd. A large white bag dangles from one of the entity's gloved hands, the gloves themselves tattered and looking worse for wear as the figure scrounges around. Stepping back, they inspect some ragged dishcloth with an insignia in its corner. They pocket the dishcloth and turn slightly towards Petris.
        
        The figure turns out to be Juvius, and beneath the oversized hobo's coat, she looks dressy and proper in a black-n-white pant suit, accessorized by tall, finely shaped boots and genuine gold encircling her neck. She happens to glance up and sees Petris. Her gaze rests on him a moment as does his on her.
        
        Here is how they see one another. Petris is a man others would immediately assume is stern and absolutely upright. His nose is long, his skin smooth, and his lips a thin flat line. If not for his hair, he would come off as gloomy and bland. As for Juvius, she was a pug-nosed, round-faced pixie of a woman. Her features were not striking, but the look of her eyes was so straight and clear, her hair was subtly painted the colors of the sea, and she dressed so well and not a hair stuck out, such that no one knew how to judge her at a glance. She was the very definition of the word 'anomaly'.
        
        Juvius looked away from Petris, scanned the rest of the refuse, and finding nothing, strode towards the sidewalk. She passed Petris as if he were not there. Without thinking, Petris followed after her.
        
        Together, they walked. Juvius made no comment. They entered the subway, climbed onto the train, four stops later disembarked, and strolled down the streets of a dingier neighborhood than Petris was used to. He refused to skip a step as he watched Juvius' back. When she turned, he turned, but not without sparing a glance over his shoulder, wondering if someone might mug him.
        
        Juvius never once faltered in her strong and steady gait, except to stop at the front of her apartment building, at which she spun on her heel and faced Petris who backed from her. She looked him up and down, twice.
        
        Juvius
        Can I help you?
        
        Petris
        No. Yes. Maybe. I don't really. I don't know.
        
        Juvius
        If you're lost, it's a little late to say it.
        
        Petris nodded. He looked around, taking in the neighborhood and grimacing when he saw fires and shadows in a parking lot opposite from them. When he faced Juvius, he found her watching him. He bowed his head and turned back to leave. Behind him, Juvius had the same intense but stone-cold expression she had the whole time, but after a moment, smiled. She rolled her eyes and entered the apartment building.
        
        To be honest, I was not certain what to write and still only have a sense of what direction this story would take. In my defense, I am intentionally not developing it as much as I could as I would prefer not to deviate from my main project, which has an exceptional amount of personal importance to me. Call it therapeutic. However, I am intrigued by Petris and Juvius.
        
        While it was an accident, they appeared in my head in what seemed to have been a subconscious answer to my plea for interesting characters. Recently, provided that I have been reflecting more frequently on story-writing than I have in years, I arrived at the conclusion that story is not plot. It is the unraveling voice of its characters. At least for me, it is. I could personally care less for plot and progression since I figure it is subject to fascinating characters' impulses. There must be a quirk to them of some kind. If this were written strictly from a first person view or featuring one character most prominently, then it would all depend on that one character. However, here, there are two, and semi-fortunately, they do intrigue me greatly.
        
        Petris has a voice inside him that is screaming to be free. He is neither a man nor a woman, yet he has reduced himself to the simple, singular notion of the male chromosome. Admittedly, he is and was born a man. He does not contest it as he is perfectly comfortable with the designation, but in him lies a need for color. He admires female cosmetics and would prefer a physical style both feminine and masculine. While he would not much alter his physique, if he were allowed to listen to himself for a moment, he would find someone who is both of and neither from either gender.
        
        As one might guess, Juvius is the one who unlocks and releases this inner voice. She does not specifically encourage him though. One may have noticed from the introduction between these two that she is only ever focused on the task she has on hand and tolerates others to the point of letting them act like flies on the wall, which they pretty much are in her mind.
        
        This is what I figured about Juvius. She lives alone in a one-bedroom apartment with a loft, a fairly spacious work and living space where she deposits her finds, collects stacks and stacks of fabric from top-of-the-line to dodgy and cheap, and if she is not out, works tirelessly at creating attire that she herself never bothers with. All finished works are of excellent quality, unique in their use of color, patterns, and embellishments, and united by their vibrant personalities, yet she places them on a hanger and forgets them on one of the many racks taking up the bedroom. Juvius is able to live without working as her parents left her with a considerable sum when they died. The sum is not enough to deem her outstandingly rich, but it would suffice to live in moderate luxury for most of her life, if not the rest of it. However, Juvius is single-minded and absolute. Despite her hording of fabrics and materials, she is not driven by nor interested in anything materialistic.
        
        Eventually though, as one would anticipate, her single-minded pursuit of something she herself cannot fathom turns her eyes to Petris who becomes her muse. Unintentionally, she propels him into discovering and embracing his true self, caring nothing for his insecurities, wants, or confusion, yet when his confusion hinders her from creating, she gives in and shows him the secret colors of the city, which one would never be able to see if they were not allowed to see behind closed doors. She takes him to meet many people, not underground, in clubs or bars, or out on the streets. In a very civil manner, she brings him to these people's homes, where they turn out to be as beautiful and brilliant as the plethora of colors they surround themselves with.
        
        Front door. Apartment 201. Juvius stands with her hands in her pockets, waiting. She glances aside, noting Petris' nervousness. He finds her watching him and straightens up, but is no less nervous.
        
        The door opens. Then standing before them is Allaba Jurney, a tan and buxom woman with smoky make-up and dressed in a trench coat, which was odd for mid afternoon. With a grand smile, Allaba ushers them in. Juvius strides in without pretense. Petris hesitates, yet at seeing Juvius' back, he hurries past Allaba, bowing his head, muttering his greetings, and she laughs, shutting the door behind them.
        
        Juvius plops down on a couch and looks over at a rack of implements. She then shifts her gaze to Petris who follows after her. He sits in an adjacent chair, immediately fidgeting with his fingers.
        
        Allaba
        Just a moment there. Gettin' the tea.
        
        Juvius
        No problem. But here. This guy looks like he'll have an aneurysm.
        
        Moments later, Allaba exits her kitchen, carrying a tray of tea, two cups, milk, sugar, and a plate of scones, which she sets on the table in the middle.
        
        Allaba
        So who's the shaker?
        
        Juvius
        Flat dog.
        
        Allaba
        That's not too nice. How you like your tea?
        
        Petris
        Black. Thank you.
        
        Allaba
        You sure?
        
        Petris
        I'm sure. What, what about Juvius?
        
        Juvius
        I don't drink tea.
        
        Allaba plops down beside Juvius, flashing the leather stockings on her legs that at a glance have Petris sitting up straighter. He looks away, and it does not escape Allaba's attention. She chortles loudly, causing Juvius to smirk.
        
        Allaba
        Juvi, where'd you get this one?
        
        Juvius
        The street.
        
        Allaba
        How?
        
        Juvius
        I was doing my rounds, when he saw me and then he just followed me home.
        
        Allaba
        That so. You homeless?
        
        Petris
        Me? No, no. I'm fine, I have a home.
        
        Allaba
        So why were you followin' me friend here? Got you hard, did she?
        
        Petris
        I honestly have no idea why I.
        
        Juvius
        He's shy.
        
        Allaba
        I can see that. A rarity these days.
        
        Juvius
        Figured I'll add him to my collection.
        
        Allaba
        Sounds good. What're you plannin' for him?
        
        Juvius
        Hard to say. He's very colorful.
        
        Both women stare at Petris who is openly confused at their conversation and looks himself over, wondering what color they were referring to. The women merely smiled without explanation.
        
        Allaba
        How long you think it'll take?
        
        Juvius
        Hard to say. Don't even know how long I'll be in it this time.
        
        Allaba
        You never do. Scone?
        
        Juvius
        No thanks.
        
        Allaba
        When's your next feast day?
        
        Juvius
        A few days. I think next Tuesday will do.
        
        Allaba
        I'll treat ya to lunch. You and pansy here.
        
        Petris
        What? Pansy, I-
        
        A knock at the door caused all three to turn heads. As the lock started turning, Allaba set down her tea and stood, visibly preparing herself. In one swift gesture, she removed her trench coat, revealing a leather bustier and a-line shorts, a whip hanging off her hip, along with cuffs and a dangling gag. As soon as the door opened, her face contorted with rage as she stormed towards the man who appeared on the other side, bearing a box of chocolates and a balloon labeled 'For My Honey'.
        
        Allaba
        You fucking little cocksucker! You think you can waltz right in here, you puny-dicked turd, and give me that shit! I bet you suck your boss' b-dick to get 'nough scrap money for that cheap shit. On the floor, now! That's it. Crawl. Crawl like the fucking cockin' roach you are!
        
        All through the woman's barrage of insults, Petris and Juvius had watched as Allaba slammed the front door, gagged the stranger and cuffed him at his ankles, then herded him into another room, forcing him to drag himself across the floor, the whole while listening to her verbal tirade. The door banged shut behind her. The remaining two sat in relative silence, listening to Allaba and the stranger continuing with their session. While Juvius looked bored, Petris was trying to make sense of what he was hearing and what he had just witnessed.
        
        Juvius spared a glance at him. There was only silence between them until Petris looked to Juvius.
        
        Petris
        What? What is she?
        
        Juvius
        Dominatrix. Full-time and certified. Ever heard of it?
        
        Petris
        No, I. Maybe, but only in the passing exhibit in the museum or. That's a thing?
        
        Juvius
        It's what you saw.
        
        Petris
        Is it always like that?
        
        Juvius
        Depends on the client. You want to try?
        
        Petris thinks about it, pondering it long and hard as Juvius watches him. In this moment, while he's distracted, she allows herself to smile, drinking in his every gesture and every subtle nuance of his expression. The artist in her studies him so thoroughly that if she were a sculptor, she would easily cultivate his image from the clay without looking. Nevertheless, their silence stretches on.
        
        In that time, Petris changed. He visibly transforms from a gentle and proper man to one who is confident and accepting as he smiles to himself. With the smile, he faces Juvius. He wants to speak but lets his face speak for him. Juvius stands. She strides around the table, and Petris rises, meeting her. As she passes him, like usual, he follows after her, sparing a brief glance towards the closed door.
        
        They leave the apartment, Petris gently closing the door behind them.
        
        Change of scene.
        
        Inside a two-bedroom apartment near to dinnertime in the evening. Sauntering back and forth between the dining area and the kitchen, a big dark woman with a massive bust and bulging hips hums as she lays out the feast. She dances around in a sarong-like dress of brilliant colors, her curves emphasized in a way that celebrates every jiggling inch of her person. In her hair, she has a bright pink bandana, holding her hair up, feathers sticking out as if her hair were some kind of floral arrangement. This woman is Mally Hydris.
        
        At her table are three place settings and three chairs, two chairs set aside.
        
        From her door comes the sound of three rapid knocks using the small metal knocker. Mally perks up. She sings out "I'm coming" and prances to the door. When she opens it, Juvius walks in, then Petris enters, greeting Mally kindly before stepping aside, letting her close the door.
        
        Mally
        See you two made it. Sit, sit! Dinner's all out, just to need bring it on over. Sit, sit.
        
        Juvius does not hesitate in taking a seat. Petris follows her example and soon, Mally is joining them, wearing oven mitts as she sets down the last dish. She pulls off the lid to let a cloud of steam rise and dissolve in the air. Dancing and calling out, she sits.
        
        Mally
        That's it. You smell it! Ain't nothin' like ol' Mally's cheese and onion mash. Help yourself.
        
        Juvius
        How are you Mally?
        
        Mally
        I'm great. Look at me! Big, fat, and lovin' it. Oh, but I'll be needin' a new dress soon. Dally's got her weddin' soon.
        
        Juvius
        Dally's wedding, when is it?
        
        Mally
        Don't you worry. There's plenty of time. Why, hon, you look like a stick! And that's sayin' somethin' when you be sittin' next to that fairy skeleton.
        
        Petris
        I'm takin' it slow. I'm afraid I won't get to eat much if I.
        
        Mally
        Shit, you be crackers! I love it! I love him, don't you?
        
        Juvius
        He's a riot.
        
        Mally
        That he is. So you'll be joinin' us for the weddin', won't you?
        
        Petris
        I. I didn't even know there was a wedding.
        
        Mally
        We didn't either. Ma baby told me yesterday.
        
        Petris
        How long has she been engaged?
        
        Mally
        Since yesterday.
        
        Juvius
        When's the wedding?
        
        Mally
        Come on now. I told ya there'd be time.
        
        Juvius
        I'm asking for him.
        
        Mally
        You really wanna know?
        
        Juvius
        I don't think he wants to.
        
        Mally
        Look at him, he's like a fish outta water. Better close that mouth 'fore the flies come in. One month! Can you do it?
        
        Juvius
        Can.
        
        Petris
        Wait, one month!
        
        Mally
        That you heard me right.
        
        Petris
        But what about planning and the dress, and cake, and?
        
        Mally
        Is he the one gettin' married?
        
        Juvius
        I think he wants to.
        
        Mally
        With who? You? Boy's buyin' his funeral.
        
        Juvius
        Boat ticket with death.
        
        Mally
        Don't I know it!
        
        Petris
        What's wrong with if I want to marry Juvius?
        
        Silence. Both women stare at Petris who seems to feel he has asked something obvious and dumb. They do not stop. He sits up and leans back, focusing on his food.
        
        Mally
        Looks he has some sense in 'im.
        
        Juvius
        Funny. It wasn't there when I met him.
        
        Mally
        You just give it to 'im.
        
        Juvius
        At least I didn't knock him out in the process.
        
        Mally
        That's true. I'll never forget that kind ol' postgirl. She was so delicious, just my type. Oh, if I could squeeze her again!
        
        Juvius
        You'd kill her.
        
        Mally
        Already did. She's in the yam and carrots.
        
        Petris
        What the hell!
        
        Juvius
        Good one.
        
        Mally
        Look at baby boy jump! Why, if you jump any higher, my neighbor'll have her field day on your ass. That's it, you get up there.
        
        Petris
        No thanks. I think, I think I'll. May I use the bathroom?
        
        Both women point down a hall. With a bow of his head, Petris hurries away.
        
        Mally
        Boy's got good buns. Tell me you're knockin' that.
        
        Juvius
        I don't knock.
        
        Mally
        Yeah, I know you. And why not? All you do all day is work in that ol' rust machine. You make all these rags pretty as the night I saw Najulerie in a bustier and clogs, and that was the craziest turn-on I've ever had, and you ain't doin' nothin' wi' it all. What would you parents say?
        
        Juvius
        They'd leave me to it.
        
        Mally
        Sure they were your parents?
        
        Juvius
        They loved me.
        
        Mally
        Yeah, yeah, maybe just a lil' too much if I dare say so myself. Girl, you need some ass. And there's a great little slab of it dishin' out jibbly juice in there.
        
        Juvius
        That's not what he's doin'.
        
        Mally
        Bet you my new dress and a 500 commission, he is.
        
        Juvius
        Why would he? You and I didn't say even one erotic thing this whole time.
        
        Mally
        You know, I love you baby girl, but sometimes, you need a good smackin'. He was hard from the moment you two walked in!
        
        Petris
        I was not!
        
        Juvius
        He was.
        
        Mally
        Denial proves it. Were you two doin' any naughty nish-nash b'fore steppin' in my house?
        
        Juvius
        Nothing I can think of. He saw a cat.
        
        Mally
        Cat fetish. That's it. Boy's playin' furries' ball, nasty but I bet you that's why he got hard at me killin' p-girl and offerin' her bits up in that yam n carrot stuff.
        
        Juvius
        Did you really kill her?
        
        Mally
        Do the yams taste funny?
        
        Juvius
        Taste fine.
        
        Mally
        Then no.
        
        Petris
        Fuck!
        
        Juvius
        You still have that stuffed cat under your sink?
        
        Mally
        No. Coulda sworn I'd done and moved it.
        
        Petris
        Holy shit.
        
        Mally
        I'll move it later. Cat boy might need a moment.
        
        Juvius
        Sad. I'm losing to a stuffed cat.
        
        Mally
        Well that's your fault, ain't it Juvi-doll?
        
        I was just thinking that in terms of cast, if I were to actually write this out and keeping it as a screenplay, only Juvius should be a character without color. It would speak to the fact that everyone around her, including Petris, are people she sees as colorful and enthralling, while she herself is lacking due to her constant outward focus. This aligns with a thought I had earlier today.
        
        For years now, I have been irked by this notion of "black and white," where these are the absolutes, good and bad, right and wrong, or whatever, but my problem with it is if "black and white" are as much synonymous with "darkness and light" as with the aforementioned, then why, in my experience, can light be bad? Referring to the natural phenomenon, we love sunlight, and we live our day to day lives according to what light penetrates our senses. However, light can be blinding, harsh on the eyes, and so hot that one becomes dull and useless. To me, darkness may reduce the colors, but it allows one to mute the noise and focus on their target. Light is all color to the point of losing touch with them all. Juvius embodies that detachment in my mind.`

        text: `I get caught in daydreams, rather happily too, and yesterday I imagined arriving at a party for me, no one knowing that it happened to be my twenty-fourth birthday. I stole a teddy bear from some back room after having jumped off the top of the grand staircase and landing on one of the tables. Though I returned to the top of the stairs with the teddy bear, since a woman was directing me back down, I hopped onto the rail and slid down to the end, but stayed seated there, playing with the plain-looking stuffed animal.

        Suddenly, a woman appeared, a very normal, plain, black woman. She undressed, and a bed materialized to my left with a sleazy, broad-chested black man goading her to come over and ride his dong. I watched her climb onto the bed and asked her if she was a prostitute. Then it faded, and I saw her again in an alley. The timeline in my head showed it was hours earlier, and she was out with her son, strolling down some alley. That didn't seem like a good idea. However, she could see me and she was very wary of my presence, and I know I had a devilish grin on my face as I pestered her with the question "Who are you" and continuously reminded her that she was not part of my reality as I was not part of hers, only she could see me and only I could see her.
        
        The scene shifted to the market and then again to her and her son preparing for dinner, this time an hour away. Again, I prodded her for answers and to her son, something was definitely wrong with her. When I asked who he was, she snapped inside, so I told her to leave the room. I wouldn't have to move given my perspective of her reality.
        
        We went into the living room. I asked for her relation to the man from earlier. She would not answer, looking deeply unsettled, and snapped when I asked if he was the father. I asked again if she was a prostitute, which she denied. Still, I could not find what was interesting or different about her. Such an average woman.
        
        Time jump. She was in bed, and I hovered over her, still perched on the end of the stair rail. Though she was still surprised when I appeared, I was confused when I realized what I had seen initially was some kind of alternative timeline. I admitted that usually such a thing would excite me, but not this time. She was so unmistakably ordinary.
        
        We talked, my idle comments, and constant rambling made her laugh. Then I realized she was looking at me funny, the kind of funny that belonged to lovers, so I made the leap and asked if her lover was a woman. Her lover had been a woman and was the only person she had ever loved.
        
        Two women can not have a child without a surrogate. Moments prior, due to how ordinary she was, I had demanded her species, if she was an earthling, a human. She was so irritatingly vague about it, though I understood that she was simply human. However, in talk of her lover, she called the woman an angel. I thought that was impossible and tried to make sense of it in my terms and as was customary in popular culture in my reality.
        
        It was my imagination, I reasoned, and then recalled that the only beings who seem angel-like in this place are hives and winged humans. Something about the woman told me it was not the latter. When I tried to clarify, she snapped at me. She denied her lover being a hive, yet in that very same breath, she had affirmed it. Her lover had been a hive, but she only acknowledged that woman as an angel.
        
        This was an imaginary world with made-up species. Hives were beings formed from hordes of insects and, with such a constitution, were capable of shape-shifting into anything. If they did not assume any particular singular form, they feasted on any living creature or thing by gnawing, breaking down matter and flesh, as a swarm.
        
        The woman started falling asleep. I begged her, ordered her, and reasoned with her to stay awake. I was not interested in exploring or witnessing any stories. She already threatened me unintentionally a short while prior, also getting sleepy, but had listened then. The second time, though, she was gone, and I was pulled into her dreams.
        
        It was her and her lover in high school. They stood together in a crowded hall with lockers and poster boards lining the walls, a mix of sunlight and rundown factory lights illuminating the sea of faces. When I wondered how the other girl could be anything like an angel, I saw a fire and an open window, and from that window descended the angel. The two had gone to school with each other for years but never acknowledged each other until after that incident when the woman recognized her angel among her fellow classmates. I have to say, her angel said nothing to me, but they both saw me.
        
        I existed in their timeline and kept trying to erase it, shifting through the woman's memories. I could erase my existence from the woman, but not her angel who always regarded me with a knowing smirk. She was arrogant and possessive, a strange angel really but absolutely devoted to her human lover. I saw them at prom together, dancing and twirling around one another, both wearing the crowns. I actually thought the plain woman radiant, and clearly, all they saw was each other as the angel did not even acknowledge me when they swooped by. Before this, I should mention that I saw them sitting on the side of a ravine at sunset, the skies painted white, orange, and blue, the waters reflecting the mural in the sky. The two sat in companionable silence, sometimes leaning over and talking about little things.
        
        After the prom, when I wondered what happened to them, I hardly saw a life together when a car rolled over and struck the woman's angel. If that were all, she would not have died, for she was an angel, a hive. The woman appeared by the stairs. I should have mentioned that at seeing the woman's dreams come out and play as recollections, I hopped off the railing and wandered about, watching them here and there, dancing, walking about. So when I saw the crash, I was right behind the angel. 
        
        The woman appeared by the stairs, as I said, torn by grief, and her grief stabbed through my heart such that I was drawn towards her. Suddenly, the flames reared up, and I stopped, aware that her angel was burning. I could not move as the flames licked at my side, and I watched the woman break, crying into her arms, no one present to comfort her.
        
        Instinctively, my eyes darted down to her lower belly. The boy, the child I saw her caring for, belonged to the angel. I wondered if she knew or not, and found then it did not matter.
        
        My world has to make sense, I have to lay it out so that each point aligns with another. I told this to the woman earlier when she questioned me about why I had to know who she was, why I was adamant to discover what was so interesting about her, and in that moment, I found it. The disturbing thing, the creepy, endearing thing that would excite me. It did not make sense for her to bear the child of her angel. Her angel was a hive. Hives are beings formed of billions and billions of practically microscopic insects that collect together to form an intelligent creature. They could create a child by taking her DNA and procreating to then expel the new mass, hence bearing child. But in the case of fertilizing eggs, it's not possible. The insects are not capable. What they are capable of, though, is procreating inside her.
        
        That thought is what hit the nail on the head for me. The little boy materialized at my side while I was thinking, and I looked down at him, only to discover the angel's knowing smirk. Staring into his dark eyes, I realized how true and right my final conclusion was, especially as he held up a finger to his lips, his arrogant eyes telling me to be quiet.
        
        Aloud, I wondered why so many years. The angel in another form answered that it takes time to build a new form, especially with the new DNA used to construct it, and to that, I found it odd that she would insist on basing her new form on her human lover. I received no answer. It was all rushing through my head, but as I think of it now, I realize that it's another form of possession and obsession that would likely be common in this place. It could even be common among octopis and slugs since they all possess an innate ability to possess the body of another or others.
        
        I rejoiced then that I was the writer and that this was my imagination because in that truth, I could manipulate the woman's reality and return her lover to her. Sweet dreams, and she would awaken with her lover back at her side. However, this was not likely to happen for years to come. Still, it was fun to fantasize.`

        text: `You could say she was sexy, too sexy for anyone. You could say she was tireless because she put them to sleep after a lot of sex. You could even say she was sick, evil, inhumane. But I've never seen myself as anything more than troubled. This is my problem. I fuck and I fuck, but I'll never get off until I kill them. It depends what I think of them. The family. I fuck the father, then I fuck the wife. If there's a dog or horse, I'll fuck it too. And children. They're so sweet, so confused. One boy liked me so much. He screamed when he saw me, curled up and closed his eyes, but he liked me so much that with his eyes closed as I cooed at him, he threw reality away and clung to me. I stroked his hair and held him to me, smelled the sun, the dirt and grass, and a powdered boy, and shaking, I hugged him, rubbing his back as I thought of his favorite tree, where he hid the toy bird I bought him, along with the key chain from Disney World that his cousin gave him and the tattered blue baseball cap he outgrew a year ago. Such a sweet boy. I would cut off each limb, each section by the joint, and rest him in the tree. That's what I thought, and that's what I did. I'd never touch a child. I didn't have to.

        There was one man. He still lived with his parents and he was so boyish, so spineless. I couldn't stand keeping them alive, the sex always bored me, but this man was prone to tantrums and hysterics. He liked me, no, loved me because I was nice to him. I spoke softly, gently, and I sang for him. Oh, he loved me so much that if I frowned, he'd go into a fit. If I wanted something that would require his parents' help to get, he would cry and scream and beg until they surrendered, whether out of annoyance or exasperation. But these things hardly interested me. What I wanted was something only he could give me. His broken moans. His keening cries. Oh, I tortured him, drilled him with questions he could never answer, doubted him and his love, tested him to the point of killing himself to prove it. Watching as he trembled, the knife poised and prepared to dive right in, I felt wet and delighted, especially when it slipped, my face, I mean. He finally saw how serious I was, how little I cared for him, how much I wanted him to die. He froze and I sauntered over to him. He didn't even fight me, just allowed me to stab him again and again, our hands entwined on the blade of the knife, moving in and out. It was beautiful. It was sensual.
        
        You know, I like to sing to them. The children. We play games together and laugh a lot, and I sit by as they drift to sleep, humming, reading, or singing their favorite songs. It's why they adore me, especially since I'm there when they wake. I like that my singing causes their nightmares. There was one, I couldn't help myself. I sing for the children and I sing for their mothers and fathers. The man I mentioned? I sang for him, of course I sang for him. I sang:
        
        Baa, baa, black sheep
        You need a dick
        Yes ma'am, yes ma'am
        Which should I pick?
        
        I had a specific one for partners, the ones who needed the sex before they died. Man or woman, it didn't matter, I sang for them and they always ended up disobeying me. Over time. It was all on purpose. I made sure they found my name was fake. Then, at night, I would sing for them and when they would ask, I'd tell them my real name. And I'd always add:
        
        You can play
        And you can touch
        Just don't say my name
        
        They never really heard the second part, not until the foreplay started to kill me and I literally couldn't wait anymore.
        
        If you do
        And I mean it too
        I'll make steak of you
        
        I could be disobeyed, it was part of warming up, but there were a few who I had to kill, just because they said it and I kept them sliced, zipped up, and stored in the icebox. There was enough to last nearly two months. It was always a stroke of luck to get free meat, but I wasn't always home enough to cook. That's why I didn't do it often. Usually, I passed it off to my friends as a present. I told them it was rare, far from endangered, abundant you know, and if they really wanted to know, I'd smile and say there's a farm I go to up north, run by a quiet, pitiful man who bred very unique cows. His name was Mr. Todd.
        
        If you do
        And I mean it too
        I'll make pies of you
        
        Like I said, I'm troubled. I'm twenty-seven, just twenty-seven. I've been a maid, a secretary, a housekeeper, nanny, au pair, and midwife. I think if I counted, the last one would be my eighty-first. It's really hard to keep track at times. Like that slumber party, when even the parents stayed over, I really couldn't resist that night. It was begging me. My body was screaming for release, and when I finished, I was so delirious, and so perfectly sated that I forgot to check the body count. I left the house and changed to a new apartment with a new identity in the next city over. All this time, I haven't settled. Nowhere.
        
        It's been five years since I graduated. I started back in junior year, when I realized I was troubled and I wondered just how to have an orgasm. The idea simply popped in my head and I strangled the man. He didn't die, and I didn't have a full orgasm, but I knew then. I can't even remember the guy's face. He just called me kinky, then fell asleep on my bed. That night, I sat thinking. I started preparing.
        
        But now, it doesn't work. I know murder is wrong. What I've done is sick and evil, but I was satisfied and that's all that mattered until now. I'm frustrated. Killing and killing. I sort of lied about eighty-one. That was thinking of the last one that gave me any pleasure. I've been killing at least three a night since then. I think your people just caught on to my pattern. One straight shot, city to city. Sometimes I book a hotel, sometimes I don't. I stay in hotels, motels, hostels, wherever. Different age, name, face. Different voice.
        
        Sure. Lock me up. It's what I'm here for.
        
        You know, there's a rhyme I love. Everyone knows it and I guess it's so cliche of me. But didn't have to change it and with that last one, those girls dancing around the bonfire, holding hands, wreaths in their hair, carrying the dead bouquets and pretending they were witches from some movie they all loved, it seemed so perfect, so right. I can hear it in my head, see them all lying in the sand.
        
        Ring-a-ring a rosy
        Pockets full of posy
        Ashes, ashes
        They all fell down.`

        text: `My steps were practiced. After years of restless wandering and slugging over various terrains, in heels, my legs and feet were assured, but as I left the movie, it felt as if I were staggering with each drunken step. There was no movie I had ever seen before where I felt personally empowered by the female protagonist, yet as soon as I felt the swell of inspiration, bursting and blooming out of what red cavity remained, I then felt a weight rest upon my back and press me down. Figuratively speaking, the parallel of wondering what caused either was lifting my head and laying eyes on the treacherous stem of a dream weighing on my back.

        Recently, I read an article about the vast expressions across the world over for relaying sensation, feeling, and sentiment. Reading that article made me realize how limited my vocabulary and that of my native tongue was, for as many words there were of science and ideologies, there were as few for one's sensitivity to their well-being and inner workings. The article stated that an increased ability to identify one's sensations led to a more informed and able manner of coping and handling stressful situations, which I am not so surprised about. However, while leaving the cinema, I wondered then what word was there for the feeling. If I were to define it, I would have said to be full and burst with greatness, only to feel the weight of that greatness in the very same breath.
        
        The movie I left was Wonder Woman (2017) and by feeling alone, I knew if I had it, I would watch it tirelessly as I had once with Phantom of the Opera (2004), though I have no idea whatever had compelled me then to have watched it approximately five hundred times. With the music, the words, and the story, I could watch Wonder Woman again and again. At one point, the character annoyed me, being so innocent to the point of being naive, believing so blindly and charging ahead without forethought or insight, but she faced her reality and accepted it.
        
        I cannot recall whether it was a video or article, except recently, I also encountered something with the statement that no one wants to face reality. As I had settled in my seat, waiting for the movie to start, it was affirmed in my mind as I watched the AMC opening, the animations, the fiberoptic-like threads swirling and swooping on the screen. Not even a song like Katy Perry's "Chained to the Rhythm" could wake up anyone or cause them to face what is and what isn't. Music, literature, films, and sports were all forms of fantasy that we immerse ourselves in and crave. In olden days, it was not as ubiquitous and far more time consuming. However, not anymore. As Andre Agassi said "Epiphanies don't change your life. It's what you do with them…" And just as it was affirmed in Wonder Woman, it's not what one deserves, wants, or needs, it's what they believe. Our whole world revolves around belief. What we want, what we say and do, how we perceive others and their actions, even the expectations and norms we have learned from our first breath, as we cultivate it, so does it operate our will and understanding. Belief.
        
        On the ride back from the theater, with the roar of the wind against the windshield and staring out at the darkness of the freeway, suburban streets, and forests, for a moment, I saw a light streak through the clouds, bright and straight. Then it started to falter, bobbing up and down. The clouds seemed to draw the obscure object back into their dark mass, wiping away all traces of that beam of light.
        
        Reality is such a loaded word that it has come to mean nothing. There is so much to see and learn of the world, so much that to see at all requires the broadest, most airtight net to filter out the little parcels one might acquire. I wonder if I might see. My goal has always been to see. Now, I question the point and act of seeing altogether. However, there is one last thing I remember thinking at some point in the movie. It was the moment that the protagonist said no to the vision, despite lingering and wondering where it had gone after it had faded. For the longest time, or so it seems to me, I have thought that reality should be shoved in people's faces, or else they will never notice, care, or pay attention. One has to be cruel and heartless, so that when they subject another to the disconnect and shock of tearing them from their beliefs, their suffering would not be contagious. In that moment, it occurred to me I was wrong, and yet, I wondered, how was one, or even many, expected to introduce reality to another, to wipe away the clout and smoke from their eyes.
        
        I have been convinced of violence and within me remains a violent urge. In the past, I've been volatile. As a result, I've become severe, unforgiving, and quick to attack. So what am I to do?
        
        How am I to act?
        
        "Do you see another way?" I stood in a study with leather sofas, a stone-carved fireplace, and shelves of books from floor to the spiraling ceiling. At a table, men sat and smoked on pipes. Standing at a distance, what they shuffled and exchanged under hand was impossible to see, and yet, I focused in on one man with a narrow face, complete with a mustache, the thin shadow of a beard over his chin, a bed of silver curls on his head, and a coldness to his downcast gaze as he seemed inclined to peer down the length of his long, double-ridged nose. As I approached him, he glanced over, but continued the dance of hand and invisible coin. "You seem lost, little girl."
        
        Now this was not one of my musings in the car. This was now.
        
        "Don't tell me you've gotten silly ideas in that useless head of yours."
        
        I was tempted to answer, to question. Instead, I remained silent, drawing ever closer to the table, wondering what they were passing and playing. Coins and gambling chips, crystal tiles, or maybe bones and shells.
        
        "It'll never work." He leant over and threw one of the things they were trading, but I still could not see them. "Fantasies can only take what you've had and give you what you had as if you hadn't."
        
        The man reclined in his chair, puffing on the pipe, and faced me. Turned up, his onyx eyes stared at me. He tilted his head as he looked me over and seemed to contemplate me.
        
        "You will never find it here."
        
        I copied him, the gesture earning a twitch of his lip and no more. His amusement was forgotten as he reached forward, taking another trade. He collected something in his hand, setting them right. It seemed like a stack of chips, except the shape of his hand was open as if grasping a bunch of rocks.
        
        "Go to bed. You'll do better there."
        
        I was close to him, practically standing such that his arm dug into my belly. And when I gazed at the table, I saw nothing. He lowered his arm and the pipe. With his hand back in his lap, I saw even more the nothing that they were all playing with. No chips, no cards, no rocks, shells, or bones. The table was empty.
        
        "There you go, my dear." He took my hand, caressing it gently and stroking the skin. "There you have it. Nothing more than a muse and a genie. Go to bed." He kissed my hand, then released it and turned away. "Go to bed."
        
        What would happen, I wondered, if I did not go to bed. Here I sit, perpetuating this moment beyond my feeble, untrustworthy memory, and here I stand, watching the hands of the men move across the table with such dexterity and precision that it could be no coincidence what they saw and thought among one another. There was a game happening. These men were playing, despite not an inkling of odds or numbers. Perhaps only they knew and like in any game, each player was the only one who knew his own holdings, but somewhere in the heavy gestures, waves, and snaps, they knew the medium.
        
        "A little persistent tonight, aren't we?"
        
        The man peered up at me with a wry smile and blew on his pipe. He licked the stout, then laid it aside. Facing me, he crossed his legs and rested his hands one over the other on his knee.
        
        "My dear. Clearly there is no need for me to point out that you are wasting time, I'm well aware you have been taught. But what you're seeking here is not here. Take a gander. See anything amiss?" With a flourish of his hand, he implied the table and the game. The man to our left made a play, which he soon followed, except there were no distinct turns. They were moving. Constant motion and unseen pawns passing delicate hands as accurate in their movements as the knowledge fermented in their minds like a routine practiced repeatedly. Perhaps that's what it was. Instead of a game, it was a routine, elaborate and long, yet every move already foreseen and practiced.
        
        What was I looking for? I had no idea in the first place. If there was an answer from somewhere in my conscious, it seemed unlikely to be here.
        
        "That would be right, my darling. Now go."
        
        But I don't want to go.
        
        He paused, his hand frozen and hovering over the empty table top. The other players also stopped. They sat up and peered at me. Laying his hand on the table, stroking the smooth unpolished surface, the man who'd been talking to me all along turned his head to regard me, though he would not look at me. His head was cocked to one side. With a click of his tongue, he stopped himself from uttering whatever words had momentarily bobbed up for air. Slowly and deliberately, he licked his lips. Then he made a popping sound before pursing his lips together in thought.
        
        At last, he looked to me once more, but his face was blank. His stare would not waver. "Go to bed," he insisted, his voice flat with expectation. Just then, his gaze softened. When he regarded me anew, I felt seen and the urge to touch him tingled in my hands. I clenched them, fit to imagine that I was reaching out and holding his face in my hands. He stared at me as if he knew exactly what I was thinking, and he smiled. Reaching over, he picked up his pipe, still smiling.
        
        "It gets cold up there," he remarked, his gaze becoming wistful. "We'll be here when you wake." He was lying. I knew he was. His smile was gentle and reassuring. "No, we won't. You are right."
        
        With the hand holding the pipe, he waved me off. "Too much thought for the night, my little one." His voice was soft, not only reassuring but reverent. My eyes were drooping. So much to think about, except I felt that if I were to sleep, all my ideas and all my urges would fade away. There would be no Wonder Woman, no reality or question of belief. Tomorrow, or rather today, what would remain would be only insecurity and constant evasion of practice and craft.
        
        "You won't do it, my dear. You can't."
        
        I nodded and for some reason, he frowned. Taking my hand, he gave it a little squeeze. "I will always be here for you."
        
        Why?
        
        He smirked, tilting his head as he regarded me. My hand remained in his. "Because I am your stranger. You need not believe me, my darling. Am I here?" As if for proof, he raised my hand held by his close to his face, so that I might look at him as well as our hands at the same time. His hand was warm. Older with silvery hair, and in his hand where the skin was supple and withering, though his hand was big and steady as it encased my own, I felt comfort in this stranger. He would simply change with another day and the other, the next and the next and the next after that.
        
        I'm so tired.
        
        He kissed my hand, squeezed it tight as he raised it to his forehead. Compared to him, I must have been freezing.
        
        "Just a bit." He released me. This time, I felt myself retreat, yet remembered my thoughts of reality, inspiration and strength, and feelings. They could happen anywhere, come from anywhere. But I didn't think there could be an answer without a question, so I wondered what my question was.
        
        "Good night, my darling. Rest that restless head of yours just for tonight."
        
        I don't think I will. But can I?`

        text: `The place flashes in my mind: a summer house fit for a king among green hills overlooking a massive lake. But all this was a dream and a strange dream at that. In one room, I found a living area with couches, side tables, white rugs. It was the standard open beach house format with hues of white, baby blue, and tan. The floors were of a light wood, either cedar or mahogany. That's all I noticed in that living area. I had nothing to do with it, apart from trashing it at one point. After the living area, there was a step, leading to picturesque dressers of the same caramel-colored wood, probably mahogany, and white-striped baby blue wall paper. To the right was a small room with a standard white door. Due to its transparency, it seemed the wall was made of glass. Obscured glass. In that room, there was a round Persian carpet of blue diamonds and flowers, dressers to the left and right, a couch, and then after another step, a bed. On the other side of the bed was a white balustrade overlooking three gigantic panels of glass that first saw a magnificent clear pool beside a row of Dorian columns along the house, and then the lake.

        It was only later that I thought of winding stairs. Back in the living area, instead of going up the step, turning left, there was a winding stairs disappearing down, curling beneath the room with the bed. I would also later discover that the room was purposely unfinished, though how I did not notice is a bit incomprehensible. Up the step and to the right, the corner of the room was missing. It led to grass and showed the side of a more ordinary house one might live in with umber-painted wood planks. The back of the house was carved out of the hill and lined with stones, but this I will review later.
        
        I cannot remember the beginning of my dream so well, but I came into the room escorted by two men, one I suspected to be my "husband" as I later referred to him. The other man seemed like some kind of secretary or personal assistant, and for the most part, would stand in observation whenever he was present. When I first came into the room, I surveyed it, unaware what was behind the white door and obscured glass. It was just a room.
        
        I turned back to the men and glared at my husband whose face I could not see then. They left me. Some kind of event was happening at the house, and after a few moments, when the men returned, it occurred to me that I was the third wife. Something like this would usually catch my attention, but this time, it didn't.
        
        I did not touch any of the furniture. My husband and his secretary were talking, asking me questions on things that I did not care for or care to consider. It felt as if my husband was watching me. This is all speculation now, as the dream has ended and my memory is fuzzy, but I think he noticed on his second visit that I had not touched any of the furniture. I would not have held it against me to have slept on the floor rather than on the couches or bed. With his second visit, I still had yet to see the bed, and I never even noticed the stairs until the end of his third visit.
        
        Upon his third visit, I finally saw my husband's face. He was nothing more than a blur within the dream until he started talking to me in a way that was more attentive.
        
        He was an older man, middle-aged. Hefty as if he'd had shape when he was younger and a little round in the middle. Dark smooth skin. Stubby hands decked in gold rings and giant gems. He had white and brown stubble about a couple day's worth. The man was not unattractive, but aside from short stature, he was likely good-looking in prior years. Though when he started talking to me, I liked him. His voice was firm and gentle, he seemed kind. His attire was clean and simple, like an African businessman purveying an estate or venue, and I realized with the event going on in the house, how he addressed and coordinated it, he was exactly that.
        
        None of that seemed important to me. So I don't know how the subject changed or how our manner changed, but at one point in the third meeting, he chased me. I ran through the white door into the bedroom. He pinned me, tackling me before I could reach the bed, and there on the floor, he held me from behind, our hips aligned. His hands moved to my hips. He was talking. I forget most everything he said. I was aware of his secretary outside the door, watching blankly and waiting for business to resume, so I ignored him. But then my husband said something interesting. While I cannot recall exactly what it was, it was something along the lines of waiting for me. He released me, walking away and leaving. Frustrated, I trashed the room. We'd already moved the couch and knocked over a lamp when he chased me into the small bedroom, but after he left, I knocked everything over. I tore the drawers out and moved to the couches, throwing the cushions left and right, overturning the tables. Whatever I could move was moved. And only in my sudden rage did I notice the missing corner.
        
        I headed to the missing corner. My bare feet landed on the tall green grass. The sunlight was warm and I walked around the carved stone wall encircling the extension of the house. I didn't pay much attention to the patio area, but the hill climbed upward steeply. There were rectangular flower pots forming an L-shape a short distance from the stone wall, implanted on the side of the hill. Halfway down the stone wall, I heard voices and felt as if I was being called. I ran the rest of the wall and jumped into the grass, looking around the other side of the extension of the house, but someone was walking out, calling something. As fast as I could, I rounded about and with no way of hiding, I figured I'd try another strategy. Instead of jumping into the patio area, I ran along the flower pots and quickly got on all fours like a stalking cat, gazing into the flower beds up-close.
        
        My husband came out and found me. Alone, with no one else around, he approached me, and only now, it occurs to me that I could have run. I could have run over the hill and disappeared, but at that time, my only feeling was embarrassment as he called my attention, chuckling to himself, musing aloud that only I could become so involved. And to my surprise, he got on the ground with me. But he moved on the other side of the flower pots, so that our eyes would meet. He leaned away when our faces were too close.
        
        Holding a clipboard with some papers, he was talking about some agenda. It felt as if he were making them up. I thought of something, I wanted to sit on his lap and kiss him. So before he could start with his list, I made a noise, catching his attention. When he asked if something was wrong, I shook my head. He still paused watching me. Then right as he was about to resume, I spoke up. I cannot recall what I said, but it was something along the lines of a better way to be reading and reviewing that agenda he had to read. Instead of outright telling him, I asked him how long it was, or what it was like. He was suspicious and smiling, and me being my usual self a.k.a. mischievous, I coaxed him over to my side. Once he sat down, I asked him to read the agenda. He read one sentence before I stopped him, kissing him, and told him to resume. Then I saw the agenda. Not only was it not an agenda, he was making it up. The only other way to tell him that I wanted him without actually saying it, was to acknowledge his whole waiting comment and to ask for kisses in the meantime.
        
        My actual intention was to drive him into loving me without clothes, but he did not seem to respond. I found that strange and intriguing because his kisses were very heated, very fast. Still, he showed no inclination to. I have no nice way of saying it, and I don't like to say have sex with or make love with (too long). It was probably this that I liked most about him.
        
        Anyways, my dream was interrupted at this point.
        
        The house was so beautiful though, that I had to remember. It was stereotypical in scheme and abnormal in size. While I saw nothing more than my room, not having even seen what it led to below, I have thought that I would love such a place. Usually the idea of having a house in the future freaks me out, giving me chills and making me cringe, but this was fine. Not the living situation though. I don't know how agreeable I'd be to being the third wife or anyone's wife for that matter. But the mere fact that he did not respond to my urging makes me respect this dream guy a lot. He was certainly attracted to me. I would bet that he was heterosexual, meaning he did have a sexual inclination, except he did not respond, yet it was clear he wanted me with the way he held me and kissed me.
        
        This is getting too mushy, sorry people.
        
        Lastly, "Hostage." I was trying to think of what the plot would be, if I were to turn this dream into a story, of course amending some parts. While thinking of a title, for some reason, I thought of the word hostage. There is so much possibility. However, to name this dream "hostage," reminded me of a comment a friend made yesterday. Let's call them chloroform.
        
        Whenever I meet chloroform, I love reading them my stories or posts because they like to listen and their reactions are fun. Not to mention, I love the act of reading, though I do think I could be more entertaining. I read them the name of two posts, asking which they would like to hear, and then they made the comment I thought of. They said "When you write [a word or title], it could go so many ways with you." And when I thought of "Hostage," I remembered this comment, thinking particularly how right they were.`

            'The Dog that Fell in Love': {
                'The Man': `The young man strolled down the sidewalk, minding his own business. He had his hands buried in his pockets and walked with a hunch to his back, his head lowered. The people he passed paid him no mind, even bumping into him and walking off without apology. When they bumped him though, he hardly noticed.

                He was a short young man, slim with a very straight figure. Like most of his persuasion, he did not bother with tending to his appearance, except to style his hair up. Apart from that, he was baby-faced with smooth skin and narrow, chinky eyes. From his slight frown, one could tell he rarely smiled, yet if he had to, he managed to look genuine.
                
                As he wandered along, he passed a corner, where a woman and her collie came up in the opposite direction. He glanced down at the black-and-white collie whose round, doey eyes peered back at him. Inside, he felt mocked and looked away. Tightening his shoulders and lowering his gaze, he pressed on, suddenly bumping into a girl who gazed back at him meekly. He offered her a wan smile, then hurried to get away from her. He simmered.`,
                'The Dog': `The collie happily marched beside her owner, a buxom woman of older years, sporting a bright pink dress coat and matching skirt, adorned by many beads and bangles as if she wore every luxurious artifact in her house about her shoulders and neck. Taking in all the new smells, vast in range and varied in texture and nuance, the collie was delighted, her tongue lolling as she panted and kept with her owner's agitated step.

                As a collie, her fur was long with patches of white and black so big that none could tell if there was a dominant color. The hair was uncannily soft. For a canine, her build was light, thin—she was clearly a young and spritely little beast. And with her fine coat and jolly, wide eyes, she should have been some kind of show dog, but then no one ever sees a dumb dog at a show.
                
                While making their way down the sidewalk, the collie noticed a young man turning the corner. At first, he was the same as every other pedestrian. He became just another smell and silhouette taking space on the pavement, but then he was close and their eyes met. The collie stared into his miserable gaze. Something in her belly stirred, staring at the odd human, and that feeling turned into a tingling mix of dread and curiosity as she watched him trudge on. Without thinking, she pulled on her collar and leash, fighting to follow him and go to him. She saw him bump into a girl and growled a brief moment until her owner jerked her forward. Obediently, she followed, but stopping at the corner, she glanced over. With her eyes though, she could not pinpoint him in the distance. She stood straight and rigid, and waited for the light to change.`

            'The Rat from the Ceiling': {
                'The Rat': `One moment, he was scurrying through the vents and scampering through the framework of walls and hidden pipes. Then suddenly, he was falling. Lost his footing on the edge of some gaping hole and plummeted downward. He just missed slamming down against the edges of a wood lattice, but fell through and slammed his side down hard against a table. Here the humans ate—giants ambling about and talking in their booming voices, and here he was, a rat with pain shooting through his arm that had cracked upon impact. He lay panting, anxiety rising as his eyes dilated and he took in the bright world appearing.

                Suddenly, he realized one of the giants was looking at him. He scrambled up, but froze, encountering a jolt of pain through his whole left arm. Holding it up against his side, he turned one way, only to meet an edge that reminded him of the fall he just suffered. Doubling back, he hurried past towers and came out, finding two giants in immediate proximity. The one right ahead of him did not even take note and was not the one to cause him to freeze with his heart-rate accelerating. Across a gaping canyon, the other giant stared at him. Its face was contorted in a way reminiscent of disgust. He remembered, his body remembered, and if he could, he would have dashed away as fast as possible. The giant moved. He flinched. The giant ducked their head and began lifting green stalks into its mouth. It spared him several glances, but as time egged on, he realized the giant was not about to hurt him. He calmed.
                
                Still, he could not move. Frightened, he continued watching the giant. Then, he heard a scream at his back and turned his head to see a giant skirting the canyon past the far edge. More giants began shifting and moving. His heart sped up and pounded against the walls of his chest. He hyperventilated as the massive silhouettes faded in and out of his vision, their loud murmurings causing him greater panic. When he looked back to the quiet giant, the look they bore was of even greater disgust than before. In that moment, he knew he must leave.
                
                Trembling, he approached the edge where the greatest canyon stretched out to a wall of glass, where a section of it would open, letting in a draft. With his bum arm, he did not know if he could stand another fall. When he gauged the distance, he knew it was considerably smaller than the fall he suffered moments ago, but terror overtook him. Backing from the edge, he considered going to the other, wondering if it might be safer, only to note the swaying masses at the corners of his vision. There were even more giants waiting on the other side. He stilled.
                
                Rounding, he tried to determine which way to go. So scared was he and so focused on the gaping canyon leading to the glass barrier that at the very last second, when he felt a looming presence, did he catch the giant leaning over him with some metal cage and prongs he thought could stab him. He tried to duck away, but the prongs seized him by the neck. Vainly, he struggled. The prongs held firm and he was shoved into the cage as everything around him blurred and darkened from the shadows of the rusty grates.`,
                'The Customer': `The girl sat down, made her order, and after waiting patiently for about ten minutes, she was greeted with the sight of warm sustenance—some vegetables, white rice, and glistening meat. Once laid before her, she smiled and dug in hungrily. She did not like looking at the other diners, wanting to avoid eye contact with them at all costs, so she kept her head down as she ate. There was a thud at the next table.

                At first, she tried not to look, but aware of the sound echoing in her head and causing a dull sense of alarm, she peered over. She froze, laying eyes on the rat that lied on its side, sprawled out. Instantly, it occurred to her that the thud came from the rat's impact on the table. Looking up, she wondered how far the rat fell and figured that even if it just came from the ceiling, that would have been a very painful impact for its small body. She wondered if it was injured. The next second, when she glanced over, the rat had scrambled to right itself. After a moment, she was able to confirm that the rat was in fact injured, its arm bent and held close to its body.
                
                The rat hobbled about the table. When it passed the salt and pepper shakers, it froze, their eyes meeting. As she gazed into those pitch black, bulging irises, aware of the heaving chest and trembling form, extreme pity filled her. She could not look away. In that moment, she felt overwhelmed by the wish to reach out and comfort the poor creature, but she abstained, knowing that if she moved toward it, the rat would likely panic. Swallowing thickly, still wishing she could help, she forced herself to return to her meal. It was not actually difficult to resume eating. Still, she snuck glances to her left, watching the creature calm down. Eventually, it did. Then she wondered if she should make a move.
                
                All of a sudden, there was a scream from the other side of the table. She jerked up, seeing the wave of reactions as people finally realized that a rat was standing in plain sight on the edge of a table. In contained horror, she watched as the people started moving. For the second time, meeting the rat's frightened gaze, her heart wrenched. She wanted to cry, scared what these people might do. The rat started turning and hobbling about as if sensing the change in the air. Over and over again, the girl saw herself standing and walking over, coaxing, if not seizing, the rat, so that she might keep it safe. She hoped with all her might that they would be gentle. She prayed.
                
                A man came out from the kitchen then, bearing a long metal cage and prongs with conal tips. Her eyes widened in horror as he approached the edge of the table. She was more than certain the prongs would harm the poor creature. If only she had the strength, she would stop him. She would do something, but she was not strong and watched as the poor, unsuspecting creature was seized strongly by the neck. Her body trembled as her eyes watered, seeing the rat struggle meekly. The man with the prongs spared a glance at her, a look of reassurance in his gaze. She knew what he meant, and so was certain that she was misunderstood as she watched him turn away, dropping the rat into the cage.
                
                When he disappeared around a corner, she thought of what she could have done, even imagined finally taking action and going after the man, hoping to stop him and ask for care of the pitiful, injured thing. Instead, she swallowed her concerns. She peered back down at her food. Like a machine on autopilot, she picked up her utensils and finished eating.`

            'The Teacher that Played Porn': {
                'The Teacher': `She was not a typical teacher, being young and even still in college. How they allowed her to take over classes in the public school was still a wonder. For the most part, she was admired. She could be strict, but most of the time, she was bouncy and full of energy. To most, she was certainly pretty with her sleek, black curls, her exuberant smile, and her dark eyes that had a hint of twinkling gold, so no one liked telling her no, even when she did very questionable things. For instance, playing porn for her fifteen-year-old students, whenever she did not care for teaching.

                Pulling up the videos and setting them to play, she left the teacher's podium, plopping down on a nearby chair. She faced away from the video, staring at the door to make sure no one disturbed the class. In the background came the sounds of procreation and exaggerated grunts, moans, and yelps. One of the particularly long videos started to play. Though she cocked her head, recognizing it, she returned to her mobile. Today, she was more interested in reading than teaching or getting wet from some porno.
                
                She sighed to herself. With the sounds of the woman over her head, she could not fully concentrate on her digital book, though she still managed to flip pages and ingest the words. In her head, the two conflicting images bounced back and forth such that they seemed simultaneous, but one was more prominent and that irked her because soon, she was leaning back, listening.
                
                Then she noticed something. A deep muscular groan that she had often anticipated in the past was missing. She continued listening, now lowering her mobile as she focused intently. Then she heard a grunt—a very unfamiliar sound that flowed into another. The man in the video sounded frustrated. She shifted on her chair, trying to acclimate herself to the things she never noticed before. Not once did she spare a glance at the screen, since she knew it forward and back, having played it so many times. Still, it sounded so different. Her gaze drifted upward, wondering if it might be the room. Perhaps the man had always been making these sounds, she just never heard them, though with the earbuds firmly planted in her ears each time she bothered to play it, she questioned that notion.
                
                It was disturbing. She turned her head away, her gaze down, and braced herself as she slumped into the chair. For a second, she remembered the door, but figured no one would dare enter, hearing such sounds coming from the speaker system. Her heart was speeding up, there was heat pooling in her belly, and she grimaced, trying to search her mind for those sounds, the soundtrack of the video she knew, yet all she could find in her memory as she pulled it up were irregularities.
                
                There was a murmur of a name that was lost in her deep concentration, even she heard several students gasp. Somewhere in her mind, she knew the whisper should have registered with her and it sort of did, but she was more interested in trying to explain the anomalies. Then she heard all of her students gasp. Her stomach clenched. Closing her eyes and facing forward, she dug her nails into her side as she waited for the end of the video to arrive. Her free hand fiddled with the mobile. She listened and kept waiting.`,
                'The Porn Star': `The world around him felt different. He felt bigger, more powerful, his mass expanding in the dark space where he slept. Familiar tendrils of electricity whipped about. They latched onto him and awakened him, so now he was aware. He knew his time was coming. As he opened his eyes, it was his scene with the bed covered in tussled sheets, the bare walls, and a single folding screen laid out for decoration. On the bed before him was his life partner, the minx. As she laid herself out, her skin glowing in all her naked glory, he felt the usual surge of desire and strength. But out of the corner of his eye, something was wrong. He glanced over as he strode to the edge of the bed, finding a crowd of faces he did not recognize. In their giant mass, the light flicking over their blank, intense expressions, he sought one particular face—her face.

                As he bent down, he saw her. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted her in a chair off to the side, very close to the window that he and his minx were often watched from. For the first time since seeing her, she looked completely disinterested. Her sole focus was her cell phone that she cradled in her hand, every few seconds, sneaking a glance up at something he could not see. With his body pre-programmed like a machine, he went through the motions, but soon, his rhythm was disturbed as frustration filled him. Instead of his minx, he started imagining the young woman from the window. He imagined her shiny black locks splayed out around her, her face scrunched up and her lips parted—an expression he was very familiar with, since he always watched her through the window.
                
                Becoming angry, he missed his cue, then grunted out his frustrations, looking down at the minx beneath him. He knew he was off-track, but he could really care less, especially when he noticed the woman shift. She was frowning and her gaze was no longer on the cell phone in her hand. When her head lifted, for a second, he drew out his current action, hoping she was going to look at him. Instead, her gaze went to the ceiling and he ground his teeth, starting up with renewed vigor.
                
                Then the unimaginable happened. She turned away, lowered her head, and arms folding over her stomach, slumped into her chair. It looked as if she could be sleeping. Moments passed and he slowed, waiting, hoping she would look over. One glance was all he asked for. His minx mewled at his pace, but that was her track as ordained. She was supposed to make that sound. He stared plainly at the woman huddled at the corner of the window. Soon, he just stopped and without intending to, he murmured her name. He heard a few gasps.
                
                Backing away from his minx, he watched as she took over, quickly sliding her hand down. Uninterested, he did the same though, but looking over at the woman on the other side of the window, he called her name again, this time knowing what he wanted exactly. The whole sea of people watching gasped, all except for the woman in the corner. He saw her shiver. Her hand began turning her cell phone over and over, but she still did not look at him.
                
                Helpless, he turned back to his minx and goaded her, while in his mind, he imagined that woman watching him again, just as she always did before. Closing his eyes, he saw her—saw her on the bed and saw her gazing at him, and wished, and wished until he burst.`,
                'The Student': `The boy was one of the first to arrive. He usually did with his girlfriend, but today she was sick and out of habit, he assumed his place with her at the usual time, only to wait for something to happen. Glancing at his watch and thinking of what day it was, he recalled that it was her day. His girlfriend really liked this teacher, he did too—he liked looking at her because she was sweet and mesmerizing to watch. The joy she projected was always so tangible that it infected anyone and everyone.

                Other students began filing in and assuming their usual seats. Before many were even fully seated, they were already whispering in anticipation. Since it was her day, they knew she was coming and she always had the strangest, if not raunchiest topics for them. To her, nothing was off-limits and today soon proved to be one of those days that one should question how true that was. When she came in, everyone stood and greeted her. A few weeks ago, she commented on how much she liked knowing everyone was present and listening, so they made it a new habit to greet her as if she were any other teacher, which she was most definitely not.
                
                They settled in their seats, the door locked many noted. At the podium, she abruptly announced that she did not feel like teaching and they watched as she navigated the computer. As soon as she opened one particular folder, everyone''s eyes widened. He could hardly believe it too. No one could mistake the contents of the folder upon reading some of its titles. In awe, he and everyone else watched as she selected a number of them and set them to play. The next second, they were watching porn in class on the big screen.
                
                The teacher with her usual swagger sat herself down on a chair near the podium, then proceeded to get out her cell and got comfortable staring at it. In pure disbelief, he stared at the erotic sights blown up before him, the unquestionable sounds of procreation filling the classroom. After the first video was through and a tent had formed in his pants, he finally relaxed, only to notice that around him, some of his classmates were getting frisky. Then it occurred to him that if his girlfriend had been present, he could have been having some fun too. He even saw a girl disappear under the tables and the guy who benefited from her bravery was not her boyfriend, but that did not stop the guy from clasping a hand over his mouth and enjoying it.
                
                Redirecting his attention to the screen, he watched as the second video finished and the third came on. It did not seem like anything special. The man was brawny and arrogant, the woman buxom and wanton. He was almost uninterested in it until he noticed the man looking off to the side. There was something very strange about his actions, how out-of-sync it seemed. When he glanced towards his teacher, it struck him, suddenly putting two and two together, seeing that the man on the screen was reacting to his teacher's slightest movements. The angle was right. The man kept stealing glances, which for them, projected on the huge screen with every slight detail magnified ten-fold, was painfully obvious. Before even his classmates had caught on, he knew what was coming the moment he saw his teacher turn away from the screen. The man stopped and murmured their teacher's name. It was so soft that only a few caught it. Most only saw that his lips had moved. He, on the other hand, had heard and sat rooted to his chair in shock.
                
                This phenomenon was physically impossible, but it was happening and it was exciting. The idea filled him with devilish delight as soon, the man on the screen was caring for himself and this time, with confidence, called their teacher's name, earning a collective gasp from his classmates. Unconsciously, the man was rough with himself, yet never noticed, too focused on their teacher who had yet to glance the screen even once. How badly he wanted to mimic the motions of the man on the screen, but abstained.
                
                Instead, he grinned and reclined in his chair, watching as the man finally turned away and faced the woman writhing on the bed. The man closed his eyes. He knew instantly what the man was thinking of. In his shouts and barked orders meant to spur on the woman in the video, that man in the porn video was imagining their delicious teacher instead. Grinning to himself, he acknowledged the idea. The idea of their pretty teacher sprawled out on a bed was enticing. His grin lessened into a small smile as he folded his arms and continued watching. The video would end soon, so he enjoyed the man's plight, no matter how physically impossible this should be, and for a moment, he wished his girlfriend was present to enjoy it with him. She would have loved it.`

        text: `For the last couple weeks, my family has been preparing to move. To avoid bringing my old boxes, I have been going through their contents, most of which consist of old journals and writings from throughout my teenage years. Among them, I found a particularly interesting piece that I had written in response to a manga series that had held my interest for at least a month: Black Butler. This is that response...
        
        "Reeves." He glanced over his shoulder, and though he knew the boy wouldn't be there, his heart constricted when all he saw was a store window and a crowded sidewalk. "Will you come to me, Reeves?"

        The voice called him forward, the memory did. Even as he followed the crowd in crossing the street, he found himself drawn to the memory.
        
        "Reeves."
        
        He paused. In the distance, he sensed hatred, but not just any hatred. The sensation was cold and bitter, all encompassing of its vessel. His body responded, making him fade into nothing. Still, he heard the boy's call and saw…
        
        The green ring flashes
        His dark eyes redden
        Stalking closer, ready
        Breathing faster, ready
        Tires screeching, ready
        The green ring flashes
        
        With a cry of frustration, the devil spins away from the accident, invariably losing his chance as citizens gather to gawk and repeat their stories over and over, openly speculating.
        
        "Reeves." He stops. "Reeves?" The voice is solid and clear, but the owner, he knows, is dead. "Reeves. Look at me."
        
        For a second, he gives and the next second, he spends believing, believing every second as he turns that he will see the boy, the owner of that distant, child-like voice. He would like to believe, but reality fails him. There is no one.
        
        The devil uses the next moment to let reality settle in deep down. He stares at the spot, waiting and listening, familiarizing himself with the empty space for whatever time this would be. No one speaks. All he hears is the steady exhalations of breath, his heartbeat, the sirens, the whispers, and the patter of urgent activity. Still, there is no boy.
        
        "Reeves."
        
        He turns back into the alley.
        
        "Reeves?"
        
        He continues on, upset.
        
        "Reeves!"
        
        He runs with all hope of getting away until "Help me!" forces him to turn back. There is no one. The mouth of the alley is empty. With a silent cry, he falls to his knees. He covers his face and releases a disgruntled moan.
        
        "Reeves." He shakes his head, clutching his ears and hoping the voice will leave him alone. His body quivers uncontrollably as the urge to cry rises. "Come see my body."
        
        He grinds his teeth. Tired, he tears his hands away and glares into the emptiness. "Where," he seethes, though knowing it's all futile, "Where are you?"
        
        "I'm in the car. I was."
        
        His breath stops. Adrenaline floods his veins and propels him to his feet as he rushes to the mouth of the alley. Clinging to the wall, he peers through the sea of blue uniforms, yellow tape, and flashing sirens, and beside an overturned car that was bent and covered in shattered glass, lied a small limp body on a stretcher, white sheets stained red and a mask over an obscure face. It is but a second that feels like a year of staring before the medics hurry the small body away, and only for another second did a glimpse of the face become the boy calling his name.
        
        He retreats, backing into a trashcan, which he sidesteps, only to stumble and land on the cold, damp blacktop of the alley. In his eyes, he sees the boy's face covered by the mask, then the blank serene expression of death, just a split second contorting with pain as he grunts. As he relaxes, that pained face returns to the blank serenity of death.
        
        The devil cries, remembering the harsh, strained movements of his jaw, the rancid scent of blood and death, the mangled sight before him infested with his guilt and gluttony, and how he continued, not wanting to waste the body, the memory of the boy. The last word he heard was his own name. It was nothing more than a whisper, a gentle happy whisper, no more than the boy's last before death interrupted him. The devil grips his hands in fists, his green ring flashing.
        
        "Reeves."
        
        He grips harder.
        
        "Reeves?"
        
        He hangs his head as the blood trickles down his fingers. Nothing. Even as he anticipates the last phrase that always starts and ends with his name, it does not come, but he knows it should and starts to rock, waiting and in whispers, starts to beg for the last phrase, for the phrases to stop, for the boy to forget him—"Reeves."
        
        He freezes, breaking out in a genuine smile as relief consumes him.
        
        "You should join me."
        
        His smile fades as the words seep in, bringing with them any hope of release. As he looks about, finding no one watching him, a sudden sense of fear overtakes him as he stands, seeing the world around him in a new light. The contrast between light and dark seems so vivid that he loses his footing, frightened of the lines in the shadows. He shakes, realizing that he kneels over one such line. With shaking limbs, he climbs back to his feet, leaving his muscles tight and tense with intention. Carefully, he strides forward.
        
        The green ring flashes
        His quick breath settles
        Glass shatters, easy
        Water rises, easy
        Meets a boy, easy
        The green ring flashes
        before it sinks…`

            1: `I wandered the halls, my bare feet scraping the harsh fibers of the rugs, my fingertips gliding along the grooved walls, halting on protruding door frames and forgotten doors. In my chest was a feeling. It felt as if my heart was sinking and moment by moment, my lead feet were drowning me, pulling me against waves I could neither see nor hear, but I felt them jerking me one way then the other. I had no idea where I was, where I stood, in which hall or by what door. All I knew was the slow, stilted slide against the wall as I gave up, and when my bent leg caught my fall, I felt like a contortionist. With a slump, my body caved in and I found myself slouched over, lying against the wall with my neck straining, and I did not care.

            There were footsteps. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a leather shoe, the pointed tip appearing around the corner, reflecting the light of the lamp at the end of the hall. As another step sounded so did another shoe appear. Those shoes flowed into long gray pants, a suit jacket, and a stern-faced man with white hair and not a wrinkle in his complexion. His face was fair-skinned, the peachy kind that was healthy and decent. As his dark gaze fell on me, I wondered why he came this time. When I looked back at his face, an expression of concern formed, hidden under flawless skin and a neatly trimmed beard, his hair, even his eyebrows, all moonsilver. He blinked, turning his head down. The light caught in his eyes, turning them green.
            
            He rounded the corner and strode towards me. My gaze fell on his shoes, then lifted to his watching me.
            
            "What are you doing here," he asked gently, his expression softening. As he stooped down, he traced the line of my jaw with his gaze, then reached out and brushed the hair out of my eyes. "Why?"
            
            I shrugged and started to fall back, but he caught my shoulder. Without resistance, I noted the light touch of his gloved hands as he pulled me upright, steadying me with his fingertips. It seemed as if his hands would disappear, yet when I swayed, he laid one hand behind one of my arms, his fingers keeping me up. His hand was flat and rigid, the touch light, practically nonexistent. I slumped forward and closed my eyes. The sinking in my chest had become a weight. My stomach was in knots and I felt miserable, queasy.
            
            In my head, it felt as if he were calling my name. I could hear his voice, it was my name. But the silence of the hall was deafening, my ears were ringing. A gentle hand covered in silk lifted to my forehead and fixed my hair with soft, timid strokes.
            
            This wasn't what I wanted. I thought of saying it, then figured there was no point. There was never any point.
            
            "Are you tired?"
            
            I yawned. It wasn't meant to be an answer.
            
            "You're tired. Go, get some rest."
            
            I looked away and thought of words in print and cursive, different hands, the same person, and time. Similar words, familiar words repeated themselves over and over again. I was tired, yet not tired enough to ignore my disappointment.
            
            "Why don't you sleep?"
            
            I heard him, and could not respond. His hand left my arm. Silently he waited. I wanted to think it was in vain, that his patience was futile. Instead, I found this was enough, too much more than I could care for and a lot less important than I thought. I could blurt the words, say them, put them out there, and be done with it. This, I knew. So I said to him, "I saw. I've been reading. Sorting through the papers and throwing them away. I found some pieces from when I was. It was 2003, 4 and 2, so I guess I was nine, ten, and eleven." His hand came back and hovered over my shoulder, but I felt it clench into a fist as he drew it back. "I'm so tired."
            
            "Of?"
            
            "Of everything." I knew that was not an answer and took a breath. While I thought he would lean closer to me or touch me for comfort, he never did. He never would. No matter that he sat right in front of me, I felt alone. It was no different from him not being there at all and that was a very lonely thought.
            
            "I read things," I muttered, remembering that I had already made this point, but it did not feel as if I could hear myself. Somehow the words were for me. "Old diary entries, and I'm. I'm not who I thought I was. Even though I've had this inkling and my thoughts do repeat, I wasn't. Like it is and isn't me."
            
            He chuckled. "You're not making much sense," he whispered.
            
            I nodded. Then had to stop, yawning again, before I could elaborate. Sniffling, I thought of leaving, maybe finding a comfortable bed and closing my eyes, but there was no comfortable bed. What I had was a bed where I would lie and wait, nestled in a blanket of thick blue fluff in the middle of summer, waiting. In the darkness with no sound but the person next to me, their breaths steady and every few minutes, the rustle as they shift on their side or back, after a while, I would drift away, no idea when my eyes closed or when I lost awareness, but then I would be sleeping a dreamless sleep.
            
            "I'm not a writer." I glanced up and found the man smiling. "I wrote a lot," I muttered, watching him and his pleasant, unassuming smile. "There was a lot to go through, a lot still, but. Most of it, there's no use. The past is the past and I wonder what's the point in even keeping any of it. What's the point of dragging along the past?"
            
            "I wouldn't know." He tucks a strand behind my ear, his clothed fingers lingering and then pulling away.
            
            "It's all talk of love and waiting. Death, incest, forbidden this and forbidden that, the princess who runs and hopes for love, never getting away, never getting what she wants. Demons and more death. Or nightmares, hallucinations, and dragons. Maybe."
            
            "What's wrong with that?"
            
            I shrugged. "It's nothing more than a child's fantasies. Stories without meaning or purpose. I wonder why she was even writing."
            
            "Why you were writing."
            
            I nod and look to the man, his dark eyes watching me closely. Gone was the softness or gentle regard. Instead, in his cool constant observation of my face, he was blank and solemn. "I'm tired," I tell him, my gaze wandering and drifting to crooked door frames and scratches in the walls. When I yawned, my eyes watered and I clamped my mouth shut, not daring to look at him, not aware what expression he might have for me. My mind was in a haze. The queasiness in my gut was replaced by the weight in my chest and an acute awareness of my tingling nipples. My body felt like a cradle of bones, the peaks of my small breasts as chilled as the air in the house, but I was far from naked. In that moment though, I was aware of the empty space in my clothes, where I did and did not fill them.
            
            "You can still write," he offered.
            
            I scoffed.
            
            "Don't laugh," he muttered, chastising me quietly while reaching out his gloved hand and for a second, he grazed my jaw with his silk-covered thumb. "Smile for me."
            
            With a cough, I did just that.
            
            He smirked, uttering "Good girl." He paused. I could not look at him, yet felt his gaze roaming my face. "Tell me more."
            
            At that, I shook my head because "There isn't anymore to say." I said the gist of my troubles. Death, love, incest, all that should be wrong, and waiting. Princesses, dreams, demons, illusions, and once in a while angels, pirates, and kings, even magic, loneliness, and my agony. But nothing was ever solved. I never had any answers. There was no point in the expression for these stories. The writer who wrote nothing. "But they were never intended that way anyway."
            
            "They?"
            
            "Nothing."
            
            The man was silent and stared at me. After a moment, he nodded. He stood. As he backed up and waited for me, I followed, though it seemed harder and felt taxing. On my feet, I found myself swaying. His large, warm hand rested on my back. Though I did not jump, it was awkward and unusual. I did not bother with asking him to remove it.
            
            His hand naturally fell away as I strode forward, accepting all the lost words and useless pondering of who I had thought I was and who I turned out to be from all that loopy cursive and the shrinking print. Part of me wished his hand would stay, another part of me didn't care at all. I wished, but there was never any use in wishing, especially for someone like me who stored her wishes in torn pages, collected them in boxes and left them, only to be sorted and discarded on a later day. Wishes did not make money, neither did dreams, hope, or forgiveness. Things I barely understood and likely, I never would.`,
            2: `"So you're up?"

            I nodded, shuffling further into the room. I found the man with the young face but had silver hair, a silver beard, and silver brows, sitting alone, a plain-bound book with worn edges in his tan hands. He smirked and laid down the book in his lap, the cover closed, hiding the title. His smirk broadened as I shuffled closer. He raised his hand and gestured for me to come up beside him. I stopped, looking over him. He was big in a way that dwarfed my size. His long legs, his long arms, the fingers, the torso, the neck, even his dark lashes, even though he was sitting, I felt small and stubby in comparison.
            
            He tilted his head to the side, the pleasant smile carving his lips as he regarded me. For a moment, I wanted to touch those lips, trace them with my finger and as I thought of that, I imagined pinching them, digging my nails into his skin and if I could, I would rip those warm, dewy lips off his face, exposing the bones of his teeth and the flesh of his gums. Staring at him, missing how his expression changed yet finding the smile faded and the dark eyes cool, I drew closer to him, my hand out and though I saw it and knew what I was doing, it felt as if I were following instinct.
            
            Before I could touch his cheek, his hand came up and before he could grasp mine, I retracted it as if he had scalded me. He tilted his head the other way, regarding me with calm and lacking a smile.
            
            "What did you find," he whispered.
            
            I shrugged, cradling my hand away from him, thinking of the other day. There remained traces of the sadness, the despair, the need for affirmation. As I trudged down the hall and fell to the floor, this man came. Without a name and nothing more than his looks, he helped me stand again and barely touched me to do so. I did not feel so lost or helpless anymore, but I needed him to listen, I needed to tell someone. "I keep looking. I don't know what to keep, but I keep writing them or setting them aside, and I look at them, and I don't know what to do with them."
            
            He stared at me, his face solemn. His dark eyes seemed the color of an impenetrable night. "I don't know what to do with them," I confided, my mind distracted. An image had flashed in my mind. I saw a night like his eyes, waking with a jerk and blearily searching my room, traces of a dream, a monster that came up behind me, but I had a feeling it was worse than that. That monster meant something to me, and I sat in bed crying into my hands. Each time the blanket slid down my legs, I pulled it back up until I couldn't stand it anymore and pulled it up to cry, sinking forward to curl into myself. I could barely see my hands when I finally looked at them.
            
            "Wading through old papers and abandoned memories, I wonder. Should they be forgot? I read poems with empty words and scenes pretty and hollow, and I wonder. Carry the memories, never look again, or. If I throw them away, would I wish I had not?"
            
            I shook my head. My body was getting heavy and I was thinking about my words, which were just as hollow as those in cursive and print. My gaze fell to the arm of the chair. I had to think about it first, wonder if I would allow it, then leaned against it as I slouched over.
            
            While I thought of saying more, it seemed pointless. This man in the chair was listening. He was watching. I wondered what he saw. When I tried to imagine myself, I found myself leaning and turning away from him. The ghost of his hand grazed along my arm, stopping me. As I faced him, it did not seem as if there had been any change in him. He offered me a smile. Holding up his hand, the fingers long and outstretched towards me, his open palm staring up at me, I felt as if that hand was for me, but I did not want to touch it. The reddened flesh, the meat on his bones, was rough, creased with hard lines. His skin was dry and raw.
            
            With this man, I did not have to pretend. Turning to him, I confided in him, "I want to throw it all away."
            
            He lowered his hand and lightly gripped the arm of the chair, his gaze on me. His hand pressed down and slid against the arm, then stopped. "You could," he whispered, his voice soothing and an inkling of a smile hidden by his moonsilver beard. Mindlessly, his fingers tapped on the arm of the chair. "Throw it away."
            
            I shook my head.
            
            He smirked and mused, "Tell me why."
            
            Then, I thought of saying there was none, but that would have been to forget that I had just said it. At least, I thought I did. I replayed my words in my head, except that when I thought, I saw the words I kept reading, all those forgotten phrases, the purple ink, the blue ink, the loops, the smeared pencil. So many maps and outlines, the paragraphs going on and on, droning in my head like a tape without an end, monotonous, and in that airy, distant voice, words would repeat, echoing as in a devil's track. Like my past was brainwashing me.
            
            "I want to keep them," I said, knowing I had already said that. I caught a glimpse of his smile, but he was fading and vaguely, I knew his hand had caught mine. For the first time, it struck that he was not wearing his gloves. I could see his nails, his knuckles, and the hairs on the back of his hands. Though I know I saw his open palm, it did not seem real then, yet cradled in his hand, mine looked so small and dainty. If I could not recognize it as mine, I would have thought it belonged to someone fragile or sickly.
            
            As I watched his hand curl around mine, I thought of running, of ways to get out of this room. He lifted my hand, bringing it to his lips, but I flinched right before his lips could touch it and he paused. Slowly, gently, he released my hand. The slap against my side seemed to resound through the room.
            
            He lifted his gaze to mine and ventured to say "What did you find today?"
            
            I thought about it. "Warm rain." He tilted his head, a look urging me to continue. "A demon spots a girl in the rain and approaches her, but she denies him, saying I love the rain." He smirked and leaned back, watching me. "The demon can't forget her. He falls in love with her. Even though he only met her once. Though he thought he'd only met her once, and he couldn't get her out of his head. But when he meets her again, she. They. You know."
            
            I couldn't say fuck, make love, or have sex, so I tried to indicate it with my fingers, only to find it embarrassing.
            
            He chuckled.
            
            Forgetting me, he looked away, his eyes listless with longing and for a moment, he bit the nail of his thumb. Then he faced me once more, still smiling. As he looked at me, his eyes seemed hazy, unfocused as if he could not see me even if he tried. "Go on," he urged, his voice hoarse. He swallowed. "What else?"
            
            I tried to think and remember, finding I preferred not to, but that was the only reason for me being here. In truth, this was useless. It felt as if I were on the verge of collapsing, falling into a turning spiral that would drag me to the bottom of my own consciousness.
            
            If I closed my eyes, I would see it. Teetering, staring down at hopeless reminiscence, my own face and my hands reaching for me, in the center of the spiral, the girl that looked like me had red eyes, pearl-spotted lashes, and black hair swathing around her, her mouth contorted with rage as she moaned and reached for me. As I gazed back at her, aware that this had nothing to do with recalling anything, I felt an urge to reach back and take her hand, not to pull her out, but to get dragged down with her. I imagined a dark, silent space, just the two of us, and wondered how I could become her again. Even after eight years, I have not grown any further from her. I still want to go back, sit with her, lie in that darkness and in my head is only loss, longing, waiting, death and dreaming.
            
            I find dark eyes gazing at me expectantly. A slow smile of amusement spreads on his lips.
            
            "I don't want to," I tell him, thinking of the folders and the piles of paper. "Why do I have to keep them?"
            
            He stares at me without an answer and I cannot think of one either. In that moment, I found the perfect opportunity to walk away, musing over whether I would be back or not. Knowing that the man was watching me walk away, imagining that he might and certain he would not stop me, staring at the door drawing closer with each step forward, I reached out to push the door open, anticipating the cool wood against my fingertips, and for a second, it felt as if I had been frozen and left myself behind. Part of me never wanted to leave, and so she remained behind me as I opened the door and slipped out of the room.`,
            3: `This was becoming something of a diary, I figured, though the entries were all short stories, not even stories. They were moments I made and collected.

            When I first gazed out through the glass, I saw black trees with shadows that gawked and groaned. I saw the silver light flooding the field, the tall grasses glowing, and imagined myself going out there. For a moment then, I felt the cool soil cushion the soles of my feet, the grasses tickling the skin of my arms, and once I raised my gaze to the sky, there would be the bright, round moon in the center of the sky, dark clouds touched by its coppery halo. But then, I was back here behind the glass.
            
            The second time I gazed out through the glass, I saw a brook, giant rocks covered in moss scattered on either bank. Sunlight streamed through the trees in beams of gold, illuminating the waters and the stone. Barefoot, I could wander along, the dead leaves and pebbles tickling my feet. I could touch the bark of the trees, feel their jagged grooves and see the spots of dried sap that had trickled down their sturdy long trunks. With just a little more, I would find the brook, climb onto one of the rocks, and rest, my arms encircling my head and my legs crossed. The sound of the water, as I would close my eyes, would be a soft trickling and with my bare feet dangling, I could almost believe they were soaking among the cold rocks and wet soil of the brook. But as soon as I opened my eyes, I was again behind the glass.
            
            The third time I gazed out through the glass, I saw an awning and a deck with weathered boards. With a rocking chair to the right and some baby toys to the left, the deck was homely, despite looking over a field of gold grass stretching on towards the horizon. Nothing moved out there, but a breeze ruffled the reeds and swept by the rocking chair, sending it back and forth. I did not want to see the old woman that materialized on it, neither did I want to see the toddler sitting and tinkering with the plastic objects in bright colors of blue, orange, and green, yet when I glanced over, I saw the toddler's dark hair and familiar green eyes. His smile was broad with tiny teeth. I stepped back and saw the glass once more.
            
            In front of me was a pair of glass sliding doors, overlooking a drop where stairs and a patio had been. In their absence, the soil was left, compressed and muddy. Then there was the black grass, tall and swaying, bowing towards the other side of the field, where a wall rose higher than I could crane my neck to see its top.
            
            "See anything?"
            
            I peered back and found the silver-haired man approaching me. He came up beside me and rested one gloved hand against the frame of the door, his dark eyes looking out the weather-stained glass. After a moment, he peered down at me, his face unusual in the shade, but the tan-line just visible over the flat, rounded collar of his shirt. With his eyes clear and watching, he leaned against the wall, crossing his arms, and studied me.
            
            "Anything today," he whispered.
            
            I looked away quickly, not wanting to answer that. Instead, I said "I was thinking. It's only worth keeping things if you've got space, or some designated place like a museum or something. Like a gallery of childhood memories. But then I think of an old woman drowning in the faces framed all across her walls, the miscellaneous trinkets and totems she's collected, whether she bought them, received them, or kept them for someone else. Her house could be clean, could be tidy, you know. Rugs from a friend, a side table from her daughter, the trophies from her children lining the shelves, tattered books, an old cabinet with a caved in top showing dolls and bow-tied candles, a wedding dress hanging on the coat rack, hand-paintings tacked to the stairwell wall, lots of things. Memories. Every day. Suffocating in them, with nothing outside to steal her away and nothing inside to let her breathe. I think of that."
            
            "Does she have no one?"
            
            I looked to the man, his eyes searching mine as soon as I found his.
            
            "Nothing outside means no one. If all her memories came from friends and family, there must be no one left, if she has nothing outside."
            
            I nodded. "Nothing."
            
            He stared at me. Today, there was no warmth in his gaze. He seemed lazy, if not more aloof than usual. As his gaze wandered, darting away, it seemed he was thinking as he slowly stood and straightened, then walked off, no longer seeing me. I thought of following him, seeing where he would go. Instead, I sat down, tucking my legs beneath me and leaned forward, pressing my forehead to the glass. The floor was carpeted, the color dark when it should have been cream. The edges of the dark were black with tufts of dust escaping the crack in-between.
            
            When I looked up again and gazed outside, I saw a desert. The sands were a burnt gold that darkened all the up to the horizon, the heat forming waves in the air that distorted the dunes of sand. Overhead, a great blue sky looked as cool and inviting as a spring, but the shimmering water was out of reach. I could imagine stumbling across the sands, the soles of my feet cooking beneath me, and if I fell, my shadow would cool the hot sands caressing my skin like the licking of flames from burning coals. With the weight of the sun crushing my spine, I would still stand, no tears to spill, no sweat to pour, and carry on. I was tempted to slide open the door, but as I rested my hand on the curve of the handle, I became once more aware of the glass. When I touched it, a chill ran up my arm as if I had not expected it to be so cool.
            
            As I stared out the glass door, I willed the vision of the desert, but all I saw were the black grasses shivering and wondered why they were alive when they were the color of a starless night.`,
            4: `I sat at the table, my shoulders slouched and my dark hair hiding me from the faceless walls, the tables, the clock, and the windows watching. The only sound in the room was the trickling of water from a fish tank that stood somewhere unseen. If I looked around, I found nothing apart from the table I sat at, the formerly white carpeted floor, and the four walls. A large window stretched from end to end of the far wall in front of me, except if I looked through it, the glass was so murky as if dried suds had been smeared all over it. A clock stood somewhere behind me, its chime ripped out, and its ticking stopped, forever stuck on some time that I have not bothered to make out.

            Once again, I was tired and sinking, but this time, I had done nothing. There was no reading or sorting, no unfolding of papers or review of forgotten binders. For days now, I have avoided that place and all the words from my past crowding it, stifling and suffocating, confining not my person but my being to that singular moment and space. Enough, I wished, what more could I do to myself? But there was more. It did not seem like much more, yet there remained more.
            
            But surprisingly, that fact did not bother me. It was practically meaningless and had nothing to do with me now. Instead I did something else, I did the opposite. I started writing, and in writing, thinking, at first pleased with myself, I realized I was using more paper, creating more writing to stash away, then sort and discard later. More and more, only ever more and more. I hid my face in my hands and breathed as deeply as I could. The feel of my own hands, small with slim fingers and long, unpainted nails, my dry skin, my warmth, it was both comforting and disgusting.
            
            Heat was the last thing I wanted, yet with the palms of my hands pressed against my eyes and cheeks, I learned of my own warmth, the scent of paper, pencil lead, and human skin unmasked by any lingering perfume, just me. And for a moment, I wanted to cry. To find myself repulsive not because of any notion other than a general preference that I dislike body heat, it was not as if I disliked myself or resented myself. Despite being comfortable with my person and being, here was the conflict between my perception and my existence. I could not stand body heat, not even my own. And amid the effort of comforting myself, it was both mortifying and undeniably pathetic. But as I held my hands away from my face, I felt both relief and despair. I cried, turning down my hand, but kept my shaking hands suspended, not daring to clutch them or hide myself. Here I sat in the middle of a chasm no more apparent than the smile cracking my lips and the sting of my eyes as I tried to see a world of stained glass.
            
            Slowly, gently, I lowered my hands to the table, but as soon as my arms touched the cloth, preceding my hands, I flinched and raised them once more. They were trembling. I could only imagine how my own miserable face was not contorting to express my inner turmoil at the very inherent conflict in my own nature. This was ridiculous.
            
            Then gloved hands encircled mine, a warm body hovering over me, but there was an icy chill infused in the silk engulfing my hands as if the gloves themselves had been lain in the freezer and donned shortly before the wearer used them to soothe me. I clung to those hands, even seeking the cold from them as I leaned forward and brought them down to my cheek. It occurred to me that these hands, the gloves, were being worn by the silver-haired man, that as I pressed the palm of his gloved hand against the column of my neck, I was forcing him to touch me. That idea occurred to me, I thought of it and I knew it, yet it felt irrelevant.
            
            All I wanted was the cold, which I found further embedded in the sleeves of his jacket. It did not matter to me. While pulling him forced him against the back of my chair, I hugged his arm to my chest, the back of his hand pressing against my cheek, and his other arm wrapped around me, easily grasping my shoulder, though he did not move, did not breathe, not a sound or willful gesture. I started to shiver. His jacket and gloves were steadily warming. I begged for the cold a little more, curling up on the chair and cradling the cold-clothed arms against me, letting them engulf me completely.
            
            A hot breath ghosted over the nape of my neck, but winter-touched lips brushed against the protrusion of my spine, the bone lifted out of my craning neck. A cold cheek rested just above it. The man was cold, not only in his clothing, but in his skin.
            
            When I thought of the body covered by the sleeves and gloves I was so desperate to find comfort from, when I remembered that he would still be warm underneath, my grip lightened. Just shy of pushing his arms and hands away, I grasped his forearms and ran my hands up to his wrists, moving them away from me. There was resistance though. He still allowed me to make space for myself, keeping his arms away as soon as I rejected them, yet they hovered in front of me, around me. Though I still felt the cold seeping off him, I thought of the warmth underneath and preferred curling into myself, which only made me squirm as my body warmed up.
            
            I felt wretched again, tired and weary. Knowing he was behind me, a position I never accepted from anyone, I wanted to talk to him, tell him of the feelings I had before he arrived, but the words were dead in my throat. All I wanted was the cold, the chill. I wanted to curl up and shiver with the refreshing smell of snow and clean, crisp air, the chill of a gray winter morning. That was all I wanted and I hung my head, clasped my hands together, and imagined lying in an icebox, the nearest thing that would suffice for my need.
            
            Despite that, prepared words streamed through my conscious. I was still practicing the words, trying to formulate them for him to hear. The silver-haired man with a silver beard and silver brows, a fair wrinkle-free face that was young with eyes of bluish green, and at the moment, it seemed he was wearing silk gloves over tan hands and a jacket, or blazer, and he stood behind me, his arms motionless, still suspended to where I had pushed them away near the corners of my vision. Seeing his arms on either side of me was like seeing extensions of a throne, perhaps the kind intended only for a devil or an evil witch that has stolen the limbs of unsuspecting deal-breakers and fashioned a chair from them.
            
            I wanted to tell him, I really wanted to, except the words were blank. They had no shape or form. Everything in my head bordered my conscious, so I had no idea what I was really thinking, and yet, I still wanted to tell him, regardless how pointless or illogical it would turn out to be. If there was no cold, I at least needed to hear him say something like it's okay or why don't you. He hasn't even asked me yet, 'did you find anything today?'
            
            Maybe he knew I had done nothing and have done nothing since. It would not surprise me if he knew.
            
            At this very moment, he could see me. He was likely staring down at my hunched back and mop of dark hair, waiting or watching, maybe both. Like that first time, he should be able to ascertain what I'm feeling and what I might need to hear, and yet he is silent. He is nothing more than a ghost.
            
            When his hands finally drop and his arms pull back, I hear the rustle of his jacket as he turns, then the footfalls I had never noticed before fade as he seems to amble away.
            
            Nothing was said and I cannot help wondering why he did that, letting me use his arms and hands like that. Though I had thought of it before, only this time did I really start to consider who he really was.`,
            5: `I sat on the floor with some papers scattered around me. Flickering embers lit the fireplace and suffused the large study in a warm glow that heated my side. Beside me, the silver-haired man lounged in his chair, legs crossed, one foot bouncing, and his greenish gaze caught the flames as he stared into the fire. Gold sunlight streamed in from the window behind him. The trees seemed misty and the skies were white, but gold beams formed halos on treetops, the windowsill, and crept into the room towards the man's chair.

            My chest was hurting and every few moments, I yawned, my eyes watering. I constantly felt like I was about to sneeze, but with a sniffle and a deep, straining breath, it would go away. It had been some time, days, since I reviewed any papers. Crayons and pencils, pixelated images from older days, blue pens and purple pens, and attempts at making the white ink legible on the blurry background pictures, it was a blue booklet of old poems, which I transcribed, yet as I read each word to carry it over, I cringed and grimaced. What a simple, dark-minded child I was. I questioned her notions, reasoning this all must have been in her head. There is no way she was so dark. And yet, that girl was me, yet even then, knowing myself, I wonder how she could have been so dark and shallow, superficial practically.
            
            When I laid down the final paper, I looked up to find the silver-haired man still staring, though now he sat with his legs apart, his elbows on his knees, and his lips pressed to his clasped hands. His gaze remained fixated on the fire.
            
            As usual, I thought of saying something. Then I remembered a thought earlier. People never say what they mean to say, we're always stumbling around for words and getting it wrong. No matter that I was a very direct person, I was well aware of possessing that common tendency and despised it, so I kept my mouth shut, except for the occasional yawn and sniffle. The man made no comment.
            
            I watched as the sunlight burst through the window and highlighted his moon-silver hair from his back, turning it white and gold. He seemed as mindless as ever.
            
            Before I knew it, I found myself saying "You only exist in my world."
            
            At those words, the man looked to me, his gaze dark and solemn as he regarded me in silence. Then I thought of my own words. Once more, I was back to wondering who this man was, what role he played here and now in my day-to-day life. We were strangers, it seemed, as I did not even know his name. I only had a sense that he knew mine, yet there was never any guarantee.
            
            It was time to sleep, I knew. If I had been a good or decent person, I figured, I would have at least apologized or explained myself. Instead, I was silent again, though another yawn even stopped me a moment, becoming the singular focus of my thoughts, and then I was back to thinking things like this. At the moment, I was in no mood to explain myself for anything, to even try and continue, yet I felt I should. Whatever I was going through, I needed this. I needed to tell him, confide in him, do something because somehow I had to get through it, to sort and review and transcribe and discard, again and again, through old journals and notes, the boxes and bags that had to go. But in this state, with weights on my lashes and pressure in my head and spine, thinking of what I must do or would like to do seemed dangerous.
            
            It occurred to me that he was too silent, not a hint of concern, not a word telling me to rest like before. With my body moving on its own, I wondered if I might have crossed a boundary, if I had somehow done something wrong. My last interaction with this man was when I sat at the table and required comfort, which I found in icy jacket sleeves, cold hands and cold skin, and when he turned away from me, I wondered who he was. I really started to consider it then.
            
            A friend of mine had a theory and as she told me, I felt compelled to tell him. I wanted to say it, it was simple. She even explained to me all our recorded encounters thus far: the hallway, his hands the other time in the study, the glass illusions, and the table. A single thought she expressed and I wanted to say it, except I would not and could not in this state. I was already up, standing and staring at him, and only just now noticed the glint of his green eyes as he gazed back at me, intense and reserved. While I thought of brushing my fingertips over his eyes, his long eyelashes, his cheeks, I turned away. I had to sleep now.`

        text: `The box was packed and her fingers lingered over the interlocked folds. Though it was tattered, bent, and misshapen, the box stood intact. She slid her fingers down its sides, wedged her fingers between its bottom and the table, and with a huff, hoisted it up against her chest. As she lumbered out of the study, past the kitchen, and onto the deck out back, she thought of her flight the next day, the time to get there, the time to wake up, the passing of time itself. It was slow. Every breath was deep, every step was heavy, and the box pressing against her chest reminded her that every double thump was a second gone.

        She crossed the backyard, glancing over an expanse of brown grass with patches of green where the shade should be and where the kiddie pool was overturned. Baseballs, soccer balls, and bouncing balls congregated around the swing and slide set, which would one day become a castle turret, a pirate ship, or a spacecraft. She remembered a pair of boys, blond and brunette, seven and one, playing together and wondered what they would look like at eight and two, or seventeen and ten.
        
        The door to the large shed was open. As she strode through it, she slowed her breathing, disliking the smell of the old wood and dust. Naturally, her eyes roamed upwards towards the loft, where the Christmas decorations were boxed and the Halloween decorations stacked. She had never noticed the Halloween decorations before.
        
        The shelves were organized, every box lined up in its place, but a single slot was left for her, located just above waist height. She slid in her box and stepped back, staring at its sagging unmarked face. She frowned, crossed her arms and found she needed a deeper breath.
        
        Feelings weren't welcome in her world, nothing like sadness or longing or remorse, and yet such feelings were filling her gut. Lowering her head, she snuck in a deep, silent, and suffocating breath, her chest shaking with restraint as she lowered her arms and straightened her back. As she exhaled, she felt the fall of her shoulders. She forced herself to smile up to her eyes. Then she walked out, sliding the door shut behind her.
        
        I may be young
        But I want a rocking chair
        I'd rock back and forth all day
        I'd rock back and forth all day
        
        With a cool gentle breeze
        And warm sunlight
        With clear blue skies
        And the smell of pine
        
        I would think nothing
        I'd just close my eyes
        I would feel nothing
        And for a moment, I'd be alright
        
        I may be young
        But I want a rocking chair
        I'd rock back and forth all day
        I'd rock back and forth

        text: `There was a little boy with spiky black hair and yellowed skin, a perpetual discolored patch of skin around his right eye as if he had been punched. His lips were thin, jutting out with a constant pout and his nose was small with a button tip. His eyes were slim and pointed, the pupils such a dark shade of blue that they seemed black.

        At a young age, perhaps two or three, the boy played on the benches. He ran about, greeting people and would stand at the glass, in particular the front-most pane, where he could see the conductor step out for a few seconds or sitting at the front of the train, dressed in a dark blue uniform with a forward-facing cap. For his birthday, the boy asked for a conductor's cap.
        
        For his birthday, the boy received a conductor's cap. He wore it every day. Fixing it proudly as he strode about the train terminal, he sometimes walked right alongside one of the public decency officers and other times, he stood by a pair of doors, greeting people and bidding them farewell. Most often, men and women loved talking with him as they waited for the trains. They made him beam with pride and he made them laugh.
        
        Such a well-spoken and upbeat child he was until he lost his conductor's cap.
        
        When he was four, he would wait for hours, watching people crowd the terminal, fighting for a space inside the train or clamoring to get out. He would tilt his head, dark eyes observing people's contorted faces and noting the bruises they got from shoving each other aside. At approximately three in the afternoon, an old man would come. The old man was seen as dirty. His skin was dark and spotted as if he never bathed, collecting the streets' filth on his body rather than the bin he carried. He had warm black eyes and a thin-lipped smile that curved up to his ears. When he arrived, he liked to offer the little boy a candy before taking his hand and leading him away. As they left, the boy's gaze would always linger on the last train and the queueing passengers idling around the terminal.
        
        When the little boy was five, he sat on the bench with his legs curled in, knees pressed to his chest and at three in the afternoon, no one came for him. He would watch the people. His cheeks were often sticky with dried tears and his external pout was turned downwards. At four in the afternoon, he would start to look about, realizing his time to wait should have been over. Feeling foreign and unfamiliar, he would reach into his pocket, pulling out a wrapped candy. Instead of eating it, he would hold onto it, clenching it with his little hand as he stared at the metro doors and the lines of people. No one acknowledged him. No one questioned him. Public decency officers patrolling the terminal would pass him without even a curious glance.
        
        Two years later, the boy returned, holding the hand of a pale gray woman in a plain dark blue dress resembling a nurse's uniform. Her hair was long and thick, her brows forever furrowed as she frowned with the same thin, pouting lips as the boy's. She pulled on his hand as she walked, tugging on him as he lagged behind her and half the time, he struggled to follow her brisk pace.
        
        They stood in one of the lines. He swayed, glanced around and fidgeted, fiddling with the candy in his pocket. A couple minutes passed. Someone bumped into him, pushing him into the woman's leg. She snarled at him, scolding him as he straightened, causing him to shrink back. The stranger tried to interject and apologized, explaining that it was their fault. She smiled pleasantly at the stranger and accepted the apology, uttering her own in return, all while squeezing the boy's hand so tightly that he winced. Her ruby-painted nails dug into his skin.
        
        He felt a tug and staggered forward towards the stranger. The woman told him to apologize for being in the way. He peered between the woman and stranger. The woman stared down at him sternly. The stranger stared down at him with pity and understanding. He lowered his head, uttering a soft apology for standing in the way. The stranger accepted right as the train arrived. He looked back at the stranger, staring at them with an open plea as the woman dragged him away, but the stranger no longer saw him, joining the crowd forcing its way onto the train.
        
        At eight years old, the boy returned. He resumed his old routine of sitting for hours, watching and observing the people as he waited for three in the afternoon. Instead of sitting on the benches though, he placed himself on the floor, leaning against one of the walls, right beneath a fire-safe switch. When lunchtime came around, one of the peak hours commencing, he glanced about as thousands of people went in and out of the station, hundreds in his terminal. His stomach tightened and growled, a sensation with a corresponding sound effect that he learned to ignore after his first month back in the terminal. At three in the afternoon, he rose to his feet, grunting as he fought off pangs of hunger, and brushed himself off, then set off without another thought.
        
        Sometime in mid summer, half an hour before the time he usually left, he felt something land on his head, falling over his eyes. Lifting it up, he discovered it was a conductor's cap. He looked up to find one of the conductors standing over him. The conductor was a tall, slim-waisted man with curling hair that twisted in front and down at the back. He had a broad smile as his onyx eyes gleamed. Uncertain, the boy held up the cap, about to say that the man dropped it, only for the man to say that he remembered the boy. Puzzled, the boy cocked his head to the side, unconsciously lowering the cap.
        
        The man nodded, affirming that he just said that he remembered the boy. He then described the boy at three years old, running about and making people in the terminal happy, even standing by the glass to watch the conductors. Much to the boy's surprise, the man began recounting a time when he got out for a stretch and noticed the boy on the other side of the glass. The little boy had waved at him, so he waved back and the memory never left him.
        
        The boy was speechless.
        
        The man asked the boy what he had been doing since then, where he went and if he lived nearby. The boy hesitated. He averted his eyes and pressed his lips tight together, a look of shame inadvertently crossing his face. The man realized he was homeless. One look confirmed it, when he inspected the boy a little closer. Unsure how to proceed, he rubbed at the back of his neck. A nervous chuckle escaped him, catching the boy's attention and dark blue eyes, practically black, looked up. The man seemed to decide something and smiled with reassurance. He offered the boy his hand and asked if the boy would like something eat.
        
        At the thought of food, the boy took his hand.
        
        Two months later, the boy sat on one of the benches in the terminal early in the morning when the station had just opened. He had new clothes, a good pair of trousers and a shirt that matched his eyes. For the first time in his life, he kept his head down, not wanting anyone to see the dark patch around his right eye or the discoloration of his yellowed skin.
        
        Frightened of being seen, he stood and made his way to the wall. He stopped in front of the station's map, showing the layout of the city's metro lines. Looking left and right, checking the time, he reached up and began tracing the lines of the map. He read every station name, noted every interchange, and followed the lines from beginning to end. The northern lines were so high up that he strained on the tips of his toes to trace them. Then he tried every combination of switching lines at interchange stations. No matter how many times he traced the main lines, six times, eight times, fourteen, he did it over and over again until he heard the train approaching. It was 8 am. He jerked back and stepped away, his gaze lingering on the map as he headed for the queues to the train.
        
        From then on, every morning, he would spend an hour tracing the lines of the map. After a week, he had them all memorized, yet every morning, he was compelled to do it again. It became his morning routine before heading downtown for school.
        
        Nearly five years later, at twelve years old with a month left before his birthday, he sat on a bench in the terminal as night fell. The station was closed. Only staff remained to clean the floors, empty the bins and patrol the perimeter, lingering while waiting for their paychecks. Next to the boy sat the man, a conductor without his cap. His cap rested on the boy's head. They sat in silence, staring at the glass doors and empty train tunnels. The man asked the boy what he answered his teacher, his tone casual as if there had never been a lull between them. The boy remained silent with his head down.
        
        Moments passed. He told the man that he wanted to be a conductor.
        
        The man asked if the boy said this to his teacher. The boy shook his head and lowered his gaze. Concerned, the man sat back, crossing his arms and regarding him, watching as the boy started to kick his legs, gripping the edge of the bench. He asked again what the boy said to his teacher. This time, the boy looked at him and said something like mechanic. The man wondered why the boy said something else.
        
        The boy covered the patch on his eye, saying his dad had been something like a mechanic. Society expects sons to follow fathers and daughters to follow mothers, so even if he never knew his dad, he would follow what that man did. The man squirmed, uncomfortable as he mulled over the boy's explanation. As if it would reassure him, the boy reaffirmed that he would rather be a conductor. He wanted to be a conductor like the man sitting with him.
        
        The man stiffened and regarded the boy, a smile creeping onto his face. He flicked the conductor's cap on the boy's head, exposing the dark patch of skin and dark blue eyes almost as black as the night. His smile broadened. With his voice full of wonder and certainty, the man said that the boy will become a conductor one day. There's no doubt about it.
        
        Nine years later, the boy now a young man hurried down steps of a staff stairwell, carrying the conductor's cap given to him on his twelfth birthday, nestled in the crook of his arm. At the bottom of the steps, he stopped and fixed the dark blue uniform that matched his eyes and donned the cap. He looked out through the glass, spotted by a public decency officer. She stopped on the other side of the glass, smiling, and shook her head as she walked away and climbed the pedestrian stairs. Her smile never faltered.
        
        The young man still had thin, pouting lips and dark blue eyes as dark as night. His hair was a little long, a fringe cut just above his eyes, but the dark patch around his eye was visible. He grinned and turned right to a door leading to a control room. When he opened the door, the man now older stood from his seat, patting the other man beside him and the two muttered see you later.
        
        The older man had shaved his head. He wore a uniform more similar to a suit and did not wear a cap because it wasn't part of his uniform anymore. As the young man walked up to him, the older man smiled. They stood beside one another and uttered soft hellos and good mornings. The older man led the young man out and following, the young man squeezed a piece of candy in his pocket. They made their way to the train and when they stopped, the older man patted the young man on the shoulder.
        
        You've arrived.
        
        Son.`

        Anjelica was incredulous. She didn't know whether she was disgusted, or angry, or confused, and before she could make up her mind, she saw Karla looking at her, lower jaw jutting out like an older woman who just had to be crazy, one eye open at all times and behind the times for thirty years. Then Karla said, "There's a stink here. It's not above the table, but from down under."
        
        Angelica shook her head, drawing back, mouth open and still Karla beat her to her next word. "So you said, and I mean you said, that Jerry Ann Georgette has one hell of an ugly baby, and yet look at what came out of your sister's vagina. Dear lord, we are doomed! What you told me, you remember what you told me? Your nephews and nieces are all pretty. The boys ain't just handsome, they be pretty damn handsome, huh."
        
        Karla looked at Anjelica as if seeing from the whites of her eyes, staring the other woman down with an imaginary magnifying glass. She hummed, probing for a reply, a response, an answer, but Anjelica had folded in on herself, defeated, looking back with nothing to say.
        
        As Karla shook her head, she sat back, crossed her arms, and looked at Anjelica. Not worth staring at the mute girl, she thought and looked away, only for her gaze to be drawn back and for her to look some more, because somewhere in the back of her mind, she was still waiting, waiting for the girl gone mute to say something after all her rambling about babies. She wondered about Anjelica; did the woman want a baby? It was a typical subject for their afternoon meetings every Thursday in the diner, but it was never about Anjelica having a baby. It was always everyone else's.
        
        "I don't want a baby," Anjelica whispered.
        
        Karla hardly caught it. It was as if a breeze had passed her face and only because she had nothing to pay attention to had it caught her attention. She blinked at Anjelica, piecing the words together in retrospect, and saw that Anjelica was scared.

As she focused on him and his successive mutterings, her eyes widened and her hands fell as realization dawned on her.

The man was bundled up, an ear bud dangling off the shell of his ear. She never saw his face and avoided looking at him entirely. Unfortunately, she could not miss when he pointed at her in her peripheral, muttering "I love you" when he finally got to sit down. He thanked the old woman who gestured past him to the open seat and for some unfathomable reason, muttered the "I love you."

        He only sat for one stop, offering his seat to the next passenger, and resumed his place in the doorway. At his feet, beside the rails guarding the doors opening, he had placed a market basket full of beer cans, one open. She'd seen the liquid sloshing inside and wondered, looking at the basket, if he'd stolen them all or bought them and never left the basket as he walked out. The man kept swaying. Seeing all the cans of beer, she soon recognized that he was drunk, probably one of those who forever kept themselves in a haze of short, drawled sentences like "I love you (all), no matter who you are" and "You have to keep going."
        
        As she looked away, listening and watching from her peripheral, she hoped his stop wasn't after hers. When she imagined having to pass him, What if, she thought, What if he stands in my way, calling me pretty, trying to get something I don't know, something, and so, for a moment, in her mind, she was sweeping his leg under him. If she wasn't strong enough, she'd kick him down. What if that makes him angry, what if he grabbed her? She'd dig her heel into her stomach to get over him. That's what she'd done.
        
        For a moment, she felt resolved but no less bothered or safer. When he finally got off the bus, though, she looked after him and from behind the closed doors, she watched him stop in the middle of the sidewalk, a beer in hand and fumble around. As the bus rolled past, she recited her previous thought to herself: I can forgive anyone in writing, but if I have to meet them, I probably won't care anymore.`

        text: `"I beat a dead horse. I throw shit at the fan. I stuff my foot in my mouth. I break the ice, and I bite the bullet." Bethany looked up from her fingers and grinned at Odyssi. He stared at her, dumbfounded, which did not phase her until she realized he kept staring at her and frowned. "What?"

        "Those are all idioms."
        
        She straightened up. "What."
        
        "Are all those things," he wondered with emphasis, "really what you do. What you like to do?"
        
        She shifted her head regarding him from the side as she said slowly, "Yes?"
        
        With a shake of his head, he brought his hands forth and began gesturing as he recalled each point, "You beat a dead horse." He looked at her, and she stared back, a slight furrowing between her brows. "So even when a subject has concluded or your argument has been made, you keep hammering in your point, you keep commenting on it, repeating it. Do you?"
        
        "Throwing shit at the fan means to cause trouble, or for chaos to break out, to let loose cause of some dumb mistake.
        
        "Stuffing your foot in your mouth means to say the wrong things, to keep saying the wrong things that you gotta shove something in your mouth to stop, but not only that. Contortion. You wouldn't stop talking and bending yourself all which ways about something that you had to be stopped.
        
        "Break the ice. In awkwardness or uncertainty, when meeting strangers or people to become partners or workmates with, you say the first word, you start a conversation or an activity to warm everyone up to one another.
        
        "And bite the bullet. It's something you've got to do but you don't want to do it, it's uncomfortable to do. Is this you?" Odyssi peered at Bethany. She looked uncomfortable and confused, avoiding his gaze as he peered even closer. "This is what you're like."
        
        Slowly, she shook her head and licked her lips, just to stop and bite them together. Odyssi leaned back, unimpressed, an inkling of disgust, of distaste. But before he could turn away or think to change the subject, he heard Bethany whisper, "I don't know even half of what you said." He looked at her, refocused on her. Now he was confused, and that confusion was turning to anger, stunted when she added, "I really do break ice. In Sweden, in the fall, with my dad. My brother and I bite on bullets. It's a type of cake. Throwing shit at a fan is a game. We play it every year, for one of our holidays. I didn't realize the English translation was..." Bethany stole a glance away before adding even further, "Stuffing my foot in my mouth is a thing my niece likes to do. She's just three. I'm flexible."
        
        Odyssi stared back at her, dumbfounded and a little horrified by his mistake, his anger at her supposed stupidity, not that, when he thought about it, she didn't sound stupid to him in other ways, but those ways were endearing, weren't they. "Dead horse?" He refocused on Bethany, looking into her expression if he'd really hurt her.
        
        "Dead horse is the translation we have for my people's tradition. It's like piñata. A dead horse is like a piñata."
        
        Odyssi's head fell in his hands with a groan as he berated himself for his insensitivities and assumptions. "I'm so sorry, Beth, I'm. So sorry."
        
        "Bett. 'Bet-hahn-nee'... You asked me five things I like to do for fun."
        
        He nodded behind his hands. "Yeah."
        
        "What do you like to do?"`

        text: `"You know what's so odd about my recollections of China, maybe it's not odd, but. I don't have the best memories. I was starving, there were cockroaches on my walls and sewage up to my knees. No. But there's so many peaceful places. No matter where I went. The crowds were big, the buildings were bigger and there were always spaces to be alone. Dark, quiet, undisturbed, parts of buildings where the offices were unoccupied, or a cafe in the corner of a hotel lobby in the afternoon, benches in the park, and bridges crossing rivers or ponds in schools. Always. Always."

        "Is that. That sounds so different than anything I've ever heard."
        
        Tasmina rolled her head and looked at Annie, her eyes glazed, her gaze distant and calm. Annie sat back, unsure if she was perturbed or wanting to be there, wherever Tasmina had gone in her mind, and then Tasmina was back, turning her head and brushing lint off her pant legs. "You're probably thinking Shanghai. Or Hong Kong, some such place."
        
        She stopped, stiff, and looked away. "Hong Kong is loud. They say the people are fast, always got a place to go. I thought they were too slow. Then I lived in Guangzhou." She smiled. "I was wrong."
        
        Annie shifted, stealing glances around as if there might be others in their vicinity, but there was no one, no glances, no comments, only the white noise of chatter, the coffee machine, the baristas announcing orders, and tires rolling past on the asphalt and footsteps outside. She couldn't imagine it. China was famous for being one of the most populated countries in the world with cities inhabited by upwards of 100 million like Beijing and Shanghai. There was no calm on bustling streets, no quiet spaces, nowhere to get away but in one's own apartment. There were always people, everywhere, watching, listening, stepping in or out of her way, judging, having to be seen or acknowledged for a compliment she received ten times every day.
        
        Now Annie was off in her own mind and Tasmina was studying her, the look in the other woman's eyes, the distance, but there was no peace to be found there, no focus or reassurance, or self-certainty of isolation.
        
        "Their eyes are different."
        
        "Oh." Annie jerked back, shaking herself and looked at Tasmina. "Wha-what?"
        
        A smile curved the side of Tasmina's lips. She looked away with a shake of her head.
        
        "You mean eyes?"
        
        Tasmina nodded to herself. "I don't mean shape or anything. I mean the look in their eyes is different. It's like that for people from different countries, so I noticed." She stared down at her pants and stroked the rough fabric, watching her hand, unseeing. "It shows. The poorer you are, the less you have, the look in the eyes is different. From country to country and area to area. If they'll let you see. Or if you're just another one of them. You see. The eyes are different." Her hand stopped. She didn't look away, yet she still wasn't seeing what her eyes were fixated on. "And yet." She started to smile. "I. Miss. China."
        
        "Why?"
        
        The smile fell away, replaced by a look that was not mere sadness or confusion or reverie. The look on her face and in her eyes was all of them, and none. Coming to a conclusion, it seemed, she looked at Annie and said, "Because I need somewhere to go. Again."`

        text: `"What. The hell. You doing!"

        Alex threw another ball at Louise. She jerked back, curling up, narrowly avoiding the impact, and grimaced, hearing the ball strike the wall. Her body was sore. Uncurling, she looked over at Alex, hands in fists, and cried again, "What the fuck!"
        
        "It's a ball," Alex cried back. He had another one in hand, ready to throw, but lowered it. "What the hell is wrong with you! You can't catch just one ball."
        
        Louise threw up her hands. "Why," she cried, "Why do I need to catch a mother. Fucking. Ball!"
        
        "It's not normal."
        
        "Normal?" Her jaw tightened. Her eyes zeroed in on Alex's face. She began striding right up to him. He threw the ball right at her and she held up her fist, the ball bouncing, hurtling towards Alex's foot. He lifted his foot in time, but then Louise was right there in front of him and for a split moment, he'd been glad, impressed, and he wanted to congratulate her, only she didn't stop.
        
        She grabbed him by his crotch in a grip that made him yelp, and he bent at the knees in pain. He looked at her to plead with her, only to shut his mouth as their eyes met and her nails dug into him, her grip tightening, which he hadn't thought possible. She couldn't catch a single ball, yet she could squeeze him hard enough that it was as if his penis were caught by a car door. Louise stared at him. His cries were caught in his throat. Was she waiting for him to beg?
        
        Her eyes narrowed.
        
        "You think throwing and catching balls makes me a better programmer, a better person?"
        
        She waited. He shook his head.
        
        "Wake. Up. You fucking asshole. We don't live in a world of fighting and hunting, where our physical capabilities determine our chances of survival. Being able to catch a ball or swing a racket or lift a few boxes doesn't do shit for caring for other people's wellbeing like any decent person would do. It doesn't give you sympathy or the ability to comprehend others' difficulties and disabilities. Kicking and punching won't help me figure out algorithms or study the frameworks behind complex data-intensive architectures. Do you know why being able to catch a fucking ball seems so important to you, when it does nothing for getting a job, earning money or solving your relationship issues with your third girlfriend this month?"
        
        He must have black balls by now. All he could feel was his penis being crushed, flattened.
        
        Louise saw his pain and smiled. She adjusted her fingers. For a split second, he had the relief, but before he could register his own anger, she regripped him, harder than before. His knees gave out. Now he was looking up at Louise. "Are you listening, Alex?"
        
        He nodded eagerly. He would say yes to anything, even about to utter "Yes, ma'am" until she repeated herself, "You can't keep a job. You have no money. You've already been dumped twice this month and are now, it looks like you're going to be dumped again. Have you any idea why?"
        
        She stared down at him. He nodded his head, only to shake it, wanting to curl in on himself, wanting the pain to stop.
        
        She let go.
        
        He fell back.
        
        "Empathy can be learned. Comprehension and critical thinking are supposed to be learned. Everything we are, everything we do is learned. But it gets old. Skills become stale and deteriorate over time. Even compassion. So why would I bother learning or practicing how to catch a ball, when I should be learning how to care for my mom after her stroke, or learning the new framework my boss wants to use, or designing the back-end architecture required for our new client's app, or even how to relate with children, so that I can actually get some work done when my niece's around?"
        
        Louise glared down at Alex as he finally looked up at her. "See all the shit I need to do, to learn and here you are, throwing balls at me until I'm bruised and sore. I know you're shit, and I'm your friend, but friends don't hurt each other. And sure as hell! Friends don't try or make their friends worse off, to bring them down, to teach them useless things, and useless because I don't fucking want to learn it! I said! I actually have a life. I actually care about myself and the people around me. I've been here, I've cared for you, but you don't get to do this to me. For christ sake! I had to grab your dick so hard, just to get you to fucking listen!"
        
        Alex didn't look as if he was thinking about her words or listening to what she was saying. His expression was what it had been from the moment she released him and kept talking. He had nothing to say. It hurt and he was scared.
        
        Louise stomped her foot, landing right in front of his crotch. He stared at her foot and looked at her.
        
        "Get out. And don't come back 'til you learn to listen."
        
        She raised her foot. He scrambled away, crawling up her kitchen counters to stand up. She whipped her hand to the door, pointing, crying "Go!" He was frozen. "GO!"
        
        He hurried out. She watched and at the bang of her door, she walked over to her table, picked up her phone and messaged him "Don't come back unless you learn to listen, and actually want to act like a friend." Throwing her phone aside, she dragged her feet to her desk, grimacing as the adrenaline faded and the pain from her bruises returned. Sitting down, she glared at the wall, thinking of her supposed friend.
        
        Though she felt apologetic for hurting him, he earned it and what she really regretted was the fact that he wasn't going to try. He would think about it, only to give up, forget or excuse himself from something he couldn't learn. No google searches, no counsel from other friends or workmates, not a thought about what it meant to listen, how and how he might improve his non-existent listening skills. If he had any idea what the actions of caring and consideration were, he wouldn't come back; he would message her, call her, but Alex had no idea how to care for her, how to care for either of his parents, his friends, his workmates, his partners. He would look for an apology, try to laugh off her strength, pretend nothing happened, complain with a hope for her sympathy, a promise not to be angry or to hurt him again.
        
        They'd been friends for more than six years and she was able to be friends with him as long as he hadn't hurt her, forced his opinions on her or cornered her until she did a bad thing to get out. Whatever was wrong with him and his life, and she had a pretty good idea what all those things were, there was suffering and there was passing on your suffering. She was done. He was done.
        
        Louise sat back with a sigh, only to jerk forward, retracting from one painful spot on her back where the ball had hit particularly hard. She remembered Alex stopping, concerned, and apologizing. When she said she was fine, he threw another six balls at her before she lost count. "Fucker."`

        Patricka, Aria and Melanie all smiled.
        
        "A poster," cried Melanie.
        
        "No," Patricka said, waving it off, "It's gotta be Jelly Bean from first period."
        
        Aria burst laughing, gripping her pillow and ducked when another pillow was thrown at her. "I didn't," she choked. She pointed. "She said it!"
        
        "It's not a poster," Gwen called out, "and no." She looked at Patricka, eyes intense with an unspoken command not to tease her about it. "Not Jelly Bean."
        
        "Okay, okay," Patricka conceeded, holding up her hands, "It's Justin!" She screamed and shook her arms. Gwen reached around her, finding a pencil case. Patricka dove to the right, dodging it and raised her ankle in triumph. "I know I'm right."
        
        Melanie sat back. She saw Gwen throwing things, but she was thinking and absently, scratched at her temple. As Patricka listed more names—Gwen's apparently endless list of teenage crushes—and as Aria watched, smiling, laughing, Melanie was strangely occupied by figuring out Gwen's thing, and she found herself recalling when Gwen greeted them at the door, but it was as if she was both herself, standing beside Patricka and Aria, and Gwen, looking at them, excited to find them standing on her doorstep.
        
        When they came in, Gwen had a book in her hand, one that she set aside without notice, or so it seemed that no one would have noticed, except Melanie, but in her memory, Melanie hadn't seen the book set aside. It was as if she was seeing everything from Gwen's side, and she walked over. The book's cover was blurry, but she could tell where the title was and that the cover featured an image of dark blobs. It was reminiscent of an old book—a simple cover with a serif title on a white banner above a full-width image and beneath it was the credit for the author.
        
        Melanie's mind flashed back to a break between classes. Their classrooms were right next to each other and the four of them sat on the floor beside the open door. Gwen was reading, but she had a book lying in her lap, an old book.
        
        "Is that your next book," she wondered. She poked Gwen, when she didn't answer.
        
        "What is it?"
        
        She pointed at the book in Gwen's lap. "That. It looks old."
        
        "Oh, this." Gwen shifted her book and held up the one in her lap. Melanie could see the cover. "This was my dad's."
        
        "Did he give it to you?"
        
        Gwen shook her head. "No. It was left...Mom found it."
        
        "You plan on reading it?"
        
        Gwen stared at the book. She seemed in thought, but neither considerate nor attached. "I can't."
        
        Melanie frowned. "Why?"
        
        "It's my dad's favorite book. But I just. I've never opened it."
        
        Melanie leaned over and read the title—"The Fox and the Hound!"
        
        Aria and Patricka stopped and looked at Melanie, surprised. Gwen, though, she had whipped her head to Melanie and there was something about her expression, the look in her eyes that told Melanie she was right, but also, having relied on the fact that no one would guess it, Gwen hadn't been prepared to hear it.
        
        Aria scrunched her face up until her eyes popped open, wide, and with a beaming smile, she cried, "The Disney movie! I've seen that."
        
        Patricka looked from face to face, noting how Gwen turned away, head tilted, and followed up on Aria's statement, "Isn't that some old movie? Like from the 80s or something?"
        
        "Is it that old," Aria wondered and reached back, fishing in her back pocket for her phone. "Hold up." Hugging the pillow, she searched the movie.
        
        Patricka watched Gwen closely and noticed how Melanie was looking at her back. Taking a seat at her desk, Gwen spun around to face them, but her whole body looked tense, even as she tried to sit back and appear fine. Patricka turned and hoisted herself onto the bed next to Melanie. Watching Gwen, she waited for the other girl to look over at Aria, then as Aria declared the year and began reading the synopsis on Wikipedia, Patricka leaned over and whispered, "What's 'The Fox and the Hound'?"
        
        Melanie looked at Patricka. "A book," she said, not in a whisper but not loud enough to be noticed over Aria's public reading. She leaned over to add "A book she can't open" before sitting up, shaking her head to shift her hair over her shoulders.
        
        Aria finished and looked from Gwen to Melanie. "Why'd you cry out Fox and the Hound—" She gasped and looked at Gwen. "Oh, was that it? The thing?"
        
        Gwen's gaze shifted to the floor, just for a moment, but long enough that Patricka took over her silence, sitting up and saying, "Shall we watch it? Should be on Disney Plus, right?"
        
        "Right!"
        
        Patricka stood and began walking towards the door. "I'll get the TV ready."
        
        "Popcorn," Aria cried, jumping off the bed and throwing her arms out wide that she lost track of the pillow, which hit Melanie in the face. Aria bounded out the door, right after Patricka, leaving Melanie alone with Gwen.
        
        She looked at Gwen who was kicking one of her feet, gaze to the floor. Dragging herself to the edge of the bed, she got to her feet. Gwen noticed and quickly stood, inadvertently making eye contact. She mustered a smile and said "Let's get some—"
        
        "I'm sorry."
        
        Gwen frowned, but her eyes were squinting, two different feelings claiming real estate on her face. She tried to pass it off, only what came out of her mouth were flustered words, and Melanie said again, "I'm sorry."
        
        "For what?"
        
        Melanie stared back at her and Gwen looked into Melanie's face, into her friend's gaze set on her.
        
        "I'm sorry."`

        text: `They think I'm the stupid one, that's okay. I really don't mind prancing around with a cell phone and lollipop in my hands, cause then nothing else fits there. And no one expects anything. It's better than Gina and Fanny. Georgie is something else.

        "Why do you spend time with them then?"
        
        What do you mean? I get free rides, free food, and I could. Actually, that's not something I really want.
        
        "What is it?"
        
        It's nothing.
        
        "Something that girls appreciate?"
        
        You could say that.
        
        "So then, what?"
        
        So then what. I don't think Georgie knew herself as well as she thought. She's the classic Queen bee of high school, you know. Blond hair, blue eyes, and tanned skin. Her parents had the money, donated a lot to the school, and could even ruin you for any job in the city. They're that high up there. So Georgie kind of had this thing for getting what she wants. When she sees someone she likes, she goes after them and it's always the same routine. If it's a man, she fucks them until she gets bored. If it's a woman, she befriends them and pulls them along until she gets bored.
        
        "So how did you remain friends with her for so long?"
        
        I knew her since sixth. She liked me then, still likes me now. I'm also pretty useful. If you haven't noticed, everyone likes me at school. Everyone knows me and all I have to do is pull some of the victim or unwilling side kick act and they'll help me out with anything. Georgie knows it too. She's more than happy to play along. I swear it's like a kink for her.
        
        "So what about that new girl?"
        
        You think she's a kink?
        
        "You're kind of heading that way anyway."
        
        Well, that's actually the problem. I don't think Georgie knew it, but she really got herself in trouble this time.
        
        See, America was the new girl. As everyone knows, she came in mid-semester on a scholarship, coming in from somewhere else in the country. She was the dark girl with dark hair and green eyes who kept her hands in her pockets. Dressing in sleeveless hoodies and dark jeans, staying at the edges of the crowd, and keeping to herself, it was like she wasn't there at all, even though we'd heard of her. I have two classes with her, painting and math. When the teachers asked her to introduce herself, she just stood there with her eyes looking forward, hands in her pockets, and said "America. Smart, likes to fight." Then nothing. She was curt and to the point. This is what I have to say, I said it, out. And she'd say it in even less words than I just did.
        
        Now, she was weird. Understandable. She did not sit with anyone or talk to anyone. No one cared what she did, so to Georgie, there was nothing interesting or useful about her. But I had this feeling about her. I couldn't explain it. It wasn't as if she stood out or seemed like a possible friend, I just had this feeling I should watch out for her. So I would try to talk to her.
        
        It was so hard, I was actually scared! I'd sit with her, talking about this and that and whatever I could think of, but she would just glance at me, never saying anything. She'd just fiddle with a pencil in her hands, never paying attention to anything. Then I made a comment on the teacher, I admit it was a little mean, but she suddenly slammed down her pencil and stared at me. Everyone stopped and looked at us. I had to say sorry. When I turned back to America, she was looking out the window as if she'd done nothing. As the teacher started talking and some people went back to sleep or whispering, I just. I had nothing to do. I felt miffed that she had laid all the blame on me, then suddenly, I heard her saying "You shouldn't easily insult others." And that was that.
        
        Holy shit! I was like fuck, who is this girl? Like fuck, what a reaction! Don't you think?
        
        I had to find out who she was, why she came to our school. You know, I remembered her saying smart and likes to fight. So I started asking her for help on problems in class. Fuck, she was! She didn't listen in class, but she solved all the problems like ticking boxes off on a checklist. Done, done, done. Done. And when I asked her for help, she would show me how to solve the problem, and I could understand it. Just do this and this. Why? Because this and this. Oh. Like what!
        
        So I talked to her every chance I got. She responded mostly to questions. I thought she wasn't listening if I rambled on, but it turned out she was, cause when I started talking about my brother's car, she chuckled, you know, like that ha ha, that again, and then she said it. "So he got outta that bender without a dent in his wallet." Like woah!
        
        So cool.
        
        And you know, I was wondering why she was in the painting class. She didn't paint, didn't even sit with the class. While the rest of us sat at our easels, she sat at the window on a stool, staring out at nothing. I shifted my easel closer to her, so that we could talk.
        
        Why aren't you painting, I asked, it is a paint class.
        
        She smirked, would you believe it, and told me "I've never had a thing for color."
        
        I had no idea what that meant until we had a sketching day. Our teacher told us not to paint at all, just sketch and sketch. She had us get out our sketch books. America had one. I looked over her shoulder and my fucking god, she was good! She was working on a close-up of a mother looking at her newborn, so cliche, I know, but you could just see the woman's exhaustion. Her joy, her sweat, her relief. It didn't have any color, but I felt like I could just see it. I actually felt like I was butting in on a very private moment. America just smiled and chuckled at me.
        
        After that, I got it. During one class, I gave her a tub of black paint. She laughed. But she used it anyway. That was the day we were supposed to pick a classmate and paint each other. She joined us in painting that day, as well as the rest of the week because it took three days to finish the portraits. I have to say, watching her was like watching a master. Only in black paint. My portrait was so striking, I didn't want to give it to Mrs. Baelstrom. I said my face can't be graded! She had to wrestle it out of my hands. Everyone was laughing, I'm sure, but all I really remember was feeling devastated that my pretty face was being carried away from me. That was the first time America came up behind me, rested a hand on my shoulder and squeezed it. Then she left.
        
        On Monday, she gave me the portrait.
        
        So you can probably guess where I'm going with this. I became pretty good friends with America. She wasn't the kind to talk much and it wasn't as if we hung out after school, but during the two classes we had, I would say I felt as close to her as I did to Georgie, though she was a lot nicer and far less. Flashy, talkative, negative, I guess. But my friendship with her didn't mean anything to Georgie. The only way Georgie would've gotten upset is if I'd stopped sitting with her and hanging out with her as we always did.
        
        But you know what got Georgie's attention? You probably remember it. Remember I said that America said she likes to fight. There wasn't any sign of it the rest of first semester, but right as second semester started, she had that fight in the hall and you probably heard of that uppercut she got the senior with. I swear that guy went soaring! She punched him right under the jaw and he went sailing back. He actually bumped the lockers. One of the teachers came and checked him, and another came and he was frowning at her.
        
        "America," he said, all stern-like, but he's got that nasally voice, so he's not very good at it. She glared at him and he started lecturing her, but as she strode up to him, he stopped yapping. She whispered something, walking right past him. They left together. I don't know exactly what happened after that. She wasn't suspended, but after that, Georgie was really interested in her. I mean, and this is what Georgie said, who comes here on a scholarship, knocks out a senior, and doesn't get suspended for it. America apparently. Oh wait, that sounded like I meant America America, but you know what I mean, cause I'm talking about America and.
        
        "So Georgie was interested in America."
        
        Yeah. Totally. More like obsessed. At first, it seemed like she was just interested, but as America ignored her, she kind of went crazy.
        
        "What did she do?"
        
        Yeah. About that…`

Along the edge of the platform was a two-feet thick yellow line, and then three feet from the yellow line was a foot-thick green line. At first, she stood between the lines as she waited for the trains, but as she looked about, she found she had to turn to see anyone. They were all standing between the green lines of the platform. Beside the escalators, people stood in rows. Feeling out of place, she strode over to the next open spot in the row.

        As she approached, a young man with a drawing pad noticed and glanced at her. She saw and looked away. He returned to his sketch pad. Standing between the side of the escalator and the green line, she felt just as awkward in place as she did out of place, checking the screens to read a line passing across the bottom: Train arrives in 2 minutes.
        
        Thinking of the lines, she thought of coming down the escalator. Everyone stood to one side, even when no one was trying to pass them. In fact, on both escalators, whether going down or up, people lined up along the right side, an empty space all the way up or down to the left.
        
        When the train arrived, she got on, wondering if this is what she had to get used to in the future, and was that so bad?`

        text: `This morning, an odd occurrence woke me up. It was nothing physical. Actually, it was of a psychological, if not hallucinatory, nature. While I can vaguely recall my fleeting dreams about an engagement to a man that had no care for me, which despite their obscurity remain interesting, I can distinctly recall what apparition woke me. In those few moments it happened, I realize I was already waking up, caught in that twilight state between consciousness and the lack of it.

        My mind projected an eerie blackness so impenetrable that it reminded me of the phrase "night's curtain." This darkness was so unnervingly close to me as I lay on my side, my head bowed on the pillow, I gazed at it warily and saw that there was a dim illumination from somewhere attempting to reach into it as if a candle might've been lit behind or beside me. A figure head appeared and it was slowly getting closer and closer to the edge of the bed. And suddenly, it was there in my bedroom, a grotesque head on shoulders. It was a man's head, pockmarked as if his face were made from white coral, but agitated and swollen. His eyes were black and bulbous as he stared right at me, his mouth slightly agape as if caught in mid-cry. It was reminiscent of those that have been impaled.
        
        I had such a start in my chest, yet I did not actually move until I saw that right in front of my face maggots were writhing in hundreds, a mix of white and blood-coated red.
        
        Then I imagined a familiar woman crawling up my legs. She was not actually familiar though with her flaking charred skin, her desperate, horror-filled eyes and her thin lips parted to reveal no teeth, no gums or tongue, just a gaping black hole as she stared down at me. At that moment, I knew I was unquestionably awake, feeling her advance further, given I was lying in bed and I could make out my bedroom clearly. I sat up, allowing the abhorrent visions to process. They did not abate, but at least I didn't feel paralyzed by them. Something in me or my mind alone registered that they were only visions of horror. Still, I could not shake them out and knew I was compelled to recount this strange experience.
        
        Honestly, hours prior, I had vaguely wished that I would wake up early if I could. It occurred to me that, while I was in essence forced to be awake, it could have been a subconscious answer. Alarms don't work on me, and I can equate such a subconscious response to what dependence I once had as a teenager. For example, if I was looking for keys, a bracelet, or trying to answer some problem, whether logical, moral, mathematical, psychological or literary, regardless I would wake in the same twilight state, in which I would witness an answer.
        
        If my question was simple, such as with lost keys or the bracelet, I would wander the house inside my dream, my eyesight flashing between memory and present navigation, making the world flicker violently and frequently. Nevertheless, I would figure out where the lost item was located. In another respect, such as for a psychological problem, my answer would be a scene almost exactly like reality, much like the simulations, or rather thought experiments, I was accustomed to performing as a child and teen. However, there was no what-if or conscious control, and in this manner, I got an answer that I could choose to ignore or follow.
        
        I had wished to wake early. Alarms don't work. Such an abhorrent sight effectively kept me awake.
        
        However, there is another possibility that I fear is more relevant to what had been used to construct it. Yesterday, while riding the train, I noticed a woman whose face was half-deformed, so-to-speak. One half was perfectly fine. She was bone thin, her cheeks hollow, skin dark and she was a short small woman. Her face was ordinary until she turned her head. The other half of her face had no distinct features due to gigantic purple lumps obscuring her eye and nose. The lumps resembled clumps of purple yam paste, except that they were oily and had a more fleshy, pockmarked texture. I kept sneaking glances at this woman, both intrigued and horrified by her face. I wanted to stare at it, wanted to commit it to memory. And I did. I feel a bit guilty, if only to admit that it was her sheer ugliness that attracted me. That, I know is bad, or in the very least, rude.`

        There is a similar story I have. It's the essential notion of who is your true parent. This one is simple and mundane. "Mama and Her Girlfriend" is about a woman whose children prefer her girlfriend over herself. For some reason, they think of her girlfriend as their true mother, and her as their mother's partner.
        
        In another story, two women have been close since childhood. The wittier of the two has always been infatuated with her best friend. When her friend's husband becomes abusive and her friend is desperate to keep him away from the children, she seizes the opportunity, offering herself and her home to the displaced trio. Unlike their mother who's a little slow, the children recognize the woman's infatuation, though more puzzling, recognize the woman as their true father figure and rightful partner to their simple, slow-witted mother.`

        text: `Yesterday, before class, two of my girls were running around in princess costumes: Merida from Brave and Snow White.

        The girl in Snow White is a dark girl, her color reminiscent of milk chocolate. She is thin and lanky, with the impression of height despite being the same height as those her age. She has clear eyes, wide and when she smiles, they crinkle at their edges as she laughs like a doll from the movies involved in a mischievous trick. Her features are long but petite and I can imagine that she'd have a wild kind of beauty when she is older.
        
        On her costume were two ties, the large satin sash in the back and the lace-up strings in the front. While her mother tied the back, she left the front dangling. Anyone who tried to coax her closer, she would deny, declaring she did not want them tied.
        
        However, I had another student. She was a girl with a large smile and round face, her eyes having the tendency to become narrow slits. She is of a lighter color and not as thin, giving the impression of a sporty disposition. Though she had no costume, her personality was fit for a pirate and I thought it a shame she lacked such apparel.
        
        She stopped the other girl and to my amazement, little Ms. Snow White held still as her classmate tied the front strings. Thereafter, she did not even undo the knot, and so I was reminded of two girls with an affinity for each other, growing up to be friends with lover behaviors, blind to its presence. In my head, I heard the child declaring "She's mine" and such words being taken for granted, and that while growing up, she would be the only one who could tell her friend what to do, if no one else could get through the other girl's stubborn head. However, this did not mean that they were best friends or in any way, "exclusive" to one another, and so, that is why I find such connection intriguing. Without the romantic or physical love to have yet linked them, and lacking a close friendship, to call another 'mine' at such an age and still see them as friend and person, I find that intriguing. It is possible, and only possible for I have yet to hear such a story.
        
        I wonder about this story and my notion of the two women, and to me, it would hold more meaning if their relationship were more like this in childhood than the stereotypical best friends that grew up and later found love in each other.`

        text: `If I were to write a love letter, I would describe the pungency of your scent and the curvature of your muscles beneath my hands, and the pleasure that would seep through my flesh, burying in my loins to remind me of my own womanhood, as I press against the muscles of your chest and abdomen. The sensitive nerve-endings sparking at my fingertips would not be primal enough. I would have to drag my nails across your pectorals to feel any sort of satisfaction, watching the very manifestation of my desire slash across my vision before my eyes. I would reach up and caress your warm, barely shaven cheek, inhaling the very recesses of your stench as you wrap me in your arms. I would have to lay my hands along your cheeks, delighting in the sheer masculinity of your hallow cheeks, the protrusions of your cheekbones, and the hardness of your skull beneath your temples and my touch, unsure if I can calm my racing heart and shiver of excitement as your arms constrict around me.

        In the enclosure of your arms, against the sharp protrusions of your ribs, I imagine I would squirm with sexual agitation or melt against you, burying my face in the curvature of your neck, and as roughened as your unwashed, reeking skin, I would breathe in your musk and lick the column of your throat, convulsing deep in my belly. You should turn your head down, and give me your lips, and I expect to taste your tongue, to feel your heat against my lips, too aware that this long, hard organ filling my mouth should precede the organ hardening at your groin, pressing at the curvature to my belly leading down to the aperture of my legs.
        
        Too bad this is no love letter. When we meet, I will envelop your shoulders in my arms and dig my nails into your hair, grasp it in my hand and demand the invasion of your tongue in my mouth. If you do not slam me back into a wall, I will wrap my legs around your waist, pushing down until your hard length trapped with your jeans drags along the apex of my legs, along an invisible seam wetting and softening the material between us, filling the air with the combination of our primal scents. I will grasp your head and you will fulfill my grinding needs and meet my every rise with a kiss of mingling breaths and savory tongues. As I slide up and grind against you, clinging to you with the force of my knees, I will find purchase on your shoulders, burying my nails in the sinewy flesh and grasp the rigidity of your bones, and I expect your hands to slide down my backside, to grasp the lobes of my buttocks. I will release your sides as your hot, deft hands encompass my buttocks, the tips of your fingers dipping in to the apex of my legs and teasing my wetness. Let me slide harder and grind against the base of you with explicit provocation, and listen, if only to hear my moans, my heavy pants and my keening whines begging for more of your skin, your musk, your penetrations, and hear your grunts, your groans and each withheld breath at the heady musk of our yearning sexes.
        
        Don't ask me for a better love letter than this. You don't need to hear your name on my lips for there are only the burns from your hands on my skin. Only your scent can be found in the recesses of my body, claiming every crevice where our animalistic origins permeate. If you undo the zipper and remove your garments, even a moment apart from you will cool me, and I will punish you. Even if our clothes must only be half-shorn, I will ride you, I will grip your hips between my thighs. Push up my shirt, but appease me with the joining of our loins and the heat of your belly against mine. Then you can remove your shirt and mine.
        
        Unclasp the confines of my bra, but do not caress my breasts with your sweat-coated hands. Push into my sex with aggressive intent and I will wrap my arms about your shoulders. Feel my soft, supple curves, my skin, and realize my scent sweeter to your own fills your nostrils and the scent of my hungering sex is yours, going to your head as yours goes to mine. Again, wrap your arms around me and hold me tight, with your sex grinding and filling my own, and feel the tension of pleasure strumming along your spine, the sweet delirium pumping through your veins, and in your haze, you will find my lips, my tongue. Grasp my hair as I grasp yours, claim me and cling to me, and leave the imprint of your hand on my pale back as I mark the flesh of yours. The sting of the disturbed flesh mixing with the heated air and your mind distended from the pleasure of our joined limbs, the infusion of your flesh into my own, the slick suction and warm caress of muscle from within the depths of my own sex, you will collapse into this bed of desire and suffusing passion, and I will hold you captive beneath me.
        
        If I must, I will enslave you just like this every night and when the morning comes, dispelling the night's tolerant submission, you may gaze upon me with the eyes of love that afford me my eternal beauty and youth, and in return, when I wake, I will gaze on you with eyes of promise and glory. See me with the glow of satisfaction, how it accentuates my cheeks and glows in my skin, how it wets my lips and warms my gaze, and there will be no need for love letters. My soft caresses adore you, my gentle voice worships you, and my gaze sees the world in you, and this, I expect no less from you.
        
        You can be a man worn by time or beaten to submission by social subterfuge, and I make no claim to give you the world, that I can bring an end to withering and listless hours or boredom and perverse loneliness, but give me your hard-earned practicality and the sight of your silent ruminations, and I will give you the whims and comfort of your dreams unrealized. Do no forget that I am the embodiment of a disturbingly satisfactory nightmare, an endless, if not suffocating, dream of pleasure and emotional abandon. My appeal was not meant for every man.
        
        If I could confess, it was not for any man but you, so if you see me watching you from the armchair forgotten in the corner of our living room, if our silence is heavy and persevering, if there is little more than resigned tolerance between us and our conversations are as barren as my womb, remember I do not write love letters. Watch me rise from the armchair and with the heat of your gaze on my ever curve and gesture, I will lift my shirt for you, remove the straps of my bra and unclasp the back, letting it fall to my feet. I have never needed a belt and will push down my jeans, sliding the material down my hips. When I sit, the further down the material will slide and collapse to the floor, and once more seated, I will wait for you, watching you as you watch me. Approach me with your slow and cautious steps. Measure the lengths of my legs, the curves of my calves, thighs and hips with your ravenous gaze. Only one article of clothing remains, and it is left to slake your thirst.
        
        I will never write you a love letter, but maybe you will understand that love is too temporal, too fragile and diminutive to encompass the true depth of my internal reservations for you. Love is a trend that waxes and wanes upon the prejudice of individualistic superstition. At its most primal, it is the material that constructs the fences of racism, sexism and every other immaterial division. Never expect my love letter, but should my indifference scare you, bear my body against yours and rediscover my internal reservations, and without fail, I will drown you until you have forgotten how you ever breathed without me.`

One, that question isn't asked of men; it's seen as their business. And what if, just what if, the woman is a slut, but she's a slut for other women, so every woman she comes in with is her girlfriend. But she's not asked when she brings in other women. What is the point of asking then?" Clara turned to Maria. "To affirm that one isn't lonely because a single woman is deemed available, up for grabs, open for business."

        Maria smiled to herself and ducked her head.
        
        "A man is allowed to be single in a culture of individualism, but because women are prone, yes prone, to being raped, or harassed, molested or stalked, they must have a man to protect them." Clara stopped and stared at the door. "Why not a police escort and a gun. Why are women blamed for the infallibility of their own safety when safety is a social construct, an inherent trait of social structures that respect and affirm the safety and security of others in public and shared spaces?"
        
        Maria shook her head and opened her mouth, only for Clara to cry out, "What the fuck!" Shutting her mouth, Maria burrowed into the sheets and hugged her pillow closer, peeking out at Clara as she began pacing again.
        
        "It bugs me, you know, it really bugs me." Clara began gnawing at her thumb. "Women are weaker, that's considered a fact—constantly subject to dispute and debate and comparison in studies both for and against equality, or what we really need if that's the case, equity—but because of this weakness, there comes a network of beliefs surrounding them. One, weakness allows predatory behavior—it invites abuse espousing from perceived greater strength in comparison. Do not show weakness! Others will take advantage of you."
        
        Maria dropped her gaze for a moment and thought about it, ending up nodding to herself.
        
        "On the other hand, the weak must be protected—no, not strengthened, not respected, just protected, and who is stronger? The predators. That's the whole point, the idea of apex predators. The stronger, more powerful, more resourceful the creature, the more they are owed. They are to protect the weak, the lesser, the lacking, but to protect, they must own because if they don't own, so the weak become their prey. What sense does this make!"
        
        Maria covered her ears and dropped down, peeking up from above her pillow.
        
        Clara huffed and huffed, and growled deep in her throat with her teeth bared. She struggled for words, for thoughts, and forced herself to breathe out slowly, feeling the thoughts tumble and toss in her head as the tension eased out of her limbs, but her lips were still pulled back in a snarl as the thought occurred to her, "There is no disproving, no ending a chain of circular logic. It feeds itself, it proves itself, it reinforces and becomes the norm, not only expected, the norm." She closed her mouth and sighed through her nose, becoming still and hunched.
        
        Maria stared at her, easing back, more cautious of this settled brooding that seemed like a coiled snake or compressed spring. She reached over, burrowing further into the sheets as she placed a pillow over her head and clung to the edges of the pillow she'd been holding.
        
        "When you balance on a rope, two ends must be secured. If the ends are uneven, the balance becomes skewed. If," she stressed," if we can view relationships as the bond, the bridge, the rope between two sides—no, two ends...two people, then. For the rope to be safe to cross, we must make the ends just as strong, just as high or low, just as heavy—weighted. Equity enables the two sides to produce the same force or counter forces. Equality is what it will look like."
        
        Maria leaned up, drawn to the dropping tone of Clara's voice, the lessening volume that required her to crane her neck and turn her head to cock her ear towards the other woman's whispers.
        
        "What we—what they fight for is the view of equality with the use of equity. If women are so weak, what to give them, what to enable them, what would uphold and maintain the balance? If men are so strong. How easy it is to think that they must be suppressed, that they must become less."
        
        "But they're not."
        
        Clara jerked around and located Maria on the bed, the only visible part of her being her eyes from between the pillows. Disoriented, Clara had to recall the last moment to register the words. "What do you mean?"
        
        Maria sat up, taking hold of the pillow on her head to keep it from falling. Pulling the pillow off her head, she cradled it in her arms as she said, "They're not."
        
        "What—who's not, who's not what?"
        
        Sitting cross-legged, Maria looked at Clara and clarified, "Everyone has the two sides in them. When men are weak, they're taken advantage of too, and when women are strong, or powerful, they too can abuse it and become predatory. As humans, we're emboldened by power and defensive without it."
        
        Studying Maria's expression and thinking of her words, Clara walked over, taking a seat beside her on the bed. Maria followed, still cradling the pillow as she added, "Equity and equality are concepts, they're ideas. They're words of observation, but they don't give us solutions. We have a system—like you said, social construct. The social structure that governs our lives and their happenings is formed from laws, rules, expectations, individual and communal beliefs. But what enables us to follow, reflect on and modify these aspects as needed are the products, services and resources surrounding us."
        
        Clara started to shake her head, but Maria scooted closer and insisted, "Look at what our daily appliances due, what behaviors they encourage or enable, and look at what's missing. Our material world is a reflection of our greater selves, the self that is more than the one, the individual. There isn't just a problem in how we treat each other or what we think of one another. We are human. We exist here on this planet in this room on this bed that allows us to rest and talk to one another, these walls that allow us to be unheard, fearless of other's judgment, and the light that allows us to see each other's face, see how the other moves, so that we might understand or speak less when all we want is to speak more."
        
        With that, Maria fell silent and Clara looked at her, surprised and then looked away, contemplative. "How," Clara wondered, working out Maria's words, "how do appliances, or products, give us equality, or equity?"
        
        "They don't."
        
        Clara looked at her.
        
        "When we look at them, they're the reflection of our bonds, our social structures. Just like when we look at ourselves and each other, we see that we need equality."
        
        "But how do we get it?"
        
        Maria stared back at her. "There's nothing to get. If you want society to change, you must change society—not people, not persons, not products or objects."
        
        "Doesn't it build up? One person, two people, three, a hundred, a thousand until it's everyone?"
        
        Maria glanced away and shook her head. "No." She looked at Clara. "If it builds up, why can't it trickle down?"
        
        Clara nodded.
        
        "It doesn't build up or trickle down because we are more than ourselves. How we feel comes from more than what's happening to us or what we're doing, what we think about or what we're thinking. We're affected by the piles and smears of poop on the sidewalk, pictures of ruined buildings and cute kittens in our newsfeeds, the smell of people and their stuff on the buses, the stale snacks in our cars, the light that gives us headaches and the lack of light that makes it hard to see, so we stub our toe or struggle with reading."
        
        Clara shook her head and threw out her hands. "So then how do we change?" She pleaded with Maria. "How do we make this world, this society, this culture safer for women?"
        
        "What does safe mean?"
        
        Clara looked away and flailed with her hands as she sought to answer. "It, it means being able to walk by a man without fear he'll follow you, or try to touch you, that you don't need to walk around with pepper spray or a taser, or that you don't have to take self-defense classes to ensure no one will pull you into their car, pin you against the wall in an alley or on a sofa in the back of a club, or that you don't have to be scared of what you say and how you say it so that another person doesn't get the wrong idea and then because they want it, your protests are part of the game, they're your foreplay, that it's not wrong to laugh or smile or joke or pretend to flirt because it's having a good time, being nice, being real, not fucking...foreplay or sex or."
        
        "That's a lot of not. So that's what safe is not. What does safe mean?"
        
        "The opposite."
        
        "The opposite of not isn't is. The opposite of is isn't not."
        
        Clara looked at Maria and frowned. "Who's getting all cryptic?"
        
        "I'm talking about extremes and tendencies. When we talk, when we have ideas or concepts, they are absolute, but in reality, the world is sensed and experienced through relatives. We think cold is the opposite of hot, but they're not. They're relative. We perceive something as cold when we are hotter than it and we perceive it as hot when we are colder. However, if all things were hot, there would be no concept of cold."
        
        "Okay. So your point is?"
        
        "The only reason we can perceive safety is because there is a lack of safety.  I asked you what safe means. You answered me with what safe is not. That's a relative. I'm asking for an absolute. What is safe, if there is no lack of safety?"
        
        Clara sighed and propped her head up on her hand. She shook her head. "I'm lost."
        
        "No, you're not. We're sitting here on the bed in your room in your apartment, and we're talking about women and safety."
        
        "Okay..."
        
        "What would safe mean if no one could be unsafe?"
        
        Clara's brows furrowed together. She sat up and tilted her head. Something about the wording got her thinking. "Unsafe."
        
        Maria nodded.
        
        "No one would be speeding."
        
        "Or trying to lift weights they couldn't care."
        
        Clara looked at her.
        
        "No one would have to lock their doors because no one would walk in without permission. No one would walk down poorly lit streets or have to walk too far to get home late at night. No one would be alone without someone to call for help and for that help to make it in time. No one would be judged for their clothing or their drunken behaviors because there is an understanding, signals, signs to make." Maria reached out, gently took Clara's hand and smiled at her. "You understand this right?"
        
        Clara smiled back. "Yeah."
        
        "Do you see what I mean now?"
        
        Clara nodded. "I guess."
        
        "Society is made of a lot more than just people and individuals. If you want it to change—if you want the mentality of people living in this society to change, it really means changing what we have. If being weak means for a moment, you'll stay with me and give me your strength, I'd rather be weak. If being strong means for a moment, I can stay with you and give you my strength, I'd rather be strong. But just like hot and cold, or what is and what isn't, strong and weak only exist because the other is present. It doesn't matter."
        
        Clara nodded again. Maria leaned in and naturally, Clara leaned in until their foreheads touched, closing her eyes. "We will not see that society, all of society, has changed," she whispered, "until the nature of society—from unsafe to safe—has changed. But at least. Some people are putting together pieces. They're still people though. Not a society."`

        text: `Venussa lounged on her perch, Mercuriel beside her, leaning over the railing above her head with head in her hands and a sigh on her lips, as they stared at the young, awkward man pacing the foyer floor without pants and wearing only a faux lab coat. The man went from crying and pounding on his head, moaning a name, to stomping about, swearing at the floor about flat tires and cold, rainy nights and unhaunted castles, and then he was standing tall, declaring promises and his devotion, after slamming his hand to his chest, causing himself to cough with surprise.

        "Oh, how sweet," Mercuriel swooned.
        
        Venussa glanced at her pink-and-magenta-winged companion, and then back at the four-eyed lanky man parading around in a lab coat without pants. She tilted her head, eyes narrowing on him. "What's wrong with him?"
        
        "Why, he's professing his love!" Mercuriel clapped her hands together and looked at Venussa. "He's going to win her love back."
        
        "What."
        
        Mercuriel chortled loudly. The man turned about, surprised and then suspicious, unable to find the bird that had just chirped. Venussa smiled. He thought the bird had laughed at him, wherever this strange bird was.
        
        "Oh dear," Venussa hissed, her forked tongue darting out from between her rouge lips. "Something is wrong with him."
        
        "He's being faithful."
        
        "Exactly." The man looked left and right, for some reason never bothering to look up. Venussa leaned forward from her perch and licked one of her fangs. "What if I ate him first?"
        
        "No," Mercuriel cried, grabbing her by her scale-covered arm and pleaded, "Let him find his love and win her back."
        
        Venussa did not look at Mercuriel and held up a clawed finger to shush her, watching the man closely. Even despite Mercuriel's loud squawk-like cry, he did not look up. She cocked her head, studying him. The man took off his glasses, cleaned them, and continued looking into the shadows of the room. There were many curtains, she noted, following his gaze, many doors.
        
        "His love," she said softly, continuing to watch how he turned his head and how he looked from shadow to shadow, "is fucking that fake man in the basement. She's gone."
        
        Mercuriel frowned and bit Venussa's arm.
        
        She drew back with a hiss and glared down at Mercuriel who peered up her teeth still stuck in her arm.
        
        "Who's there! Where are you!"
        
        Venussa rolled her eyes and glared down at the half-naked, four-eyed, awkward young man. "Here," she hissed. As he turned, he looked up and cried out at her bared fangs and her forked tongue.
        
        "W-what are you?"
        
        Mercuriel who still had her teeth buried in Venussa's arm blinked, and mumbled something. With a sigh, Venussa flexed, forcing Mercuriel's teeth out. As Mercuriel shook herself, ruffling her feathers, Venussa twisted around her perch and slithered down to the foyer floor. She raised herself to the young man's height and looked him in the eyes with a smile pulling at the corners of her long, chapped lips. His breath was shallow, his eyes were wide. He mouthed the words again, but only a squeak escaped him.
        
        Mercuriel flew down to join them. She spread her wings, showing off the great display of pink and magenta like a peacock, but the young man only saw Venussa whose gaze mesmerized him. Mercuriel peered closer, scrutinizing his face, the pulse in his throat, the shaking of his hands and the bulge beneath the lab coat. She squawked with rage, drawing the man's attention away, and Venussa glanced over with a smirk. Venussa slithered away as Mercuriel lunged at the young man who screamed in terror and scrambled to get away, but she caught his leg in her teeth.
        
        "This is why," Venussa mused, returning to her perch, "If there was such a thing as faithful, he wouldn't have lost his girlfriend in the first place, and he wouldn't be attacked by a lovesick bird second."`

        text: `It's been a while, but I find myself in a strange situation.

        Part of me wonders if everything is okay because I now live in a place, a space that has all I need and I do not have to interact with strangers who smoke fentanyl and set off the fire alarm, who might barge into my room and hit me in the face, whose dogs piss in the hallways, who spread their trash and jizz and piss throughout communal bathrooms, who leave boxes of vegetables in the stairwell to rot, who stick tape on the opening of doors, who call me a bitch after they turn around or call at me to never come back when I'm heading out.
        
        I have been sick the last week, in and out of an electric blanket warmed bed with a view of the city at night, eating bell peppers and hummus, ginger beef stew and rice, and having used up a box of tissues. The days are passing. I keep thinking of projects I need to do, want to do, and have no idea what I would do if I were to finish. My head is almost always throbbing in pain, making it difficult to think. All I can do is plan, calculate simple numbers and what-ifs.
        
        At this moment, I want to write 'dear stranger', which I haven't done in years, not that I haven't needed to. I want to think I'm scared, I'm anxious, I'm uncertain, but, fortunately and unfortunately, I feel only misplaced. I am aware that I, the thought, the consciousness, know. I, the body, the unconscious, always need my time. There is no mine for months to come, no sense of comfort and refuge in this foreign space registered with my name. This is my address. This is where my bed is and where my clothes are.
        
        For how long though?
        
        The last place I lived at, I lived there for very nearly two years after the homeless shelter. It took one year to become comfortable, a year and a half to call it mine. There is an income requirement that seems, based on my impressions of the people here, it will be more strictly upheld. If I get the job I want, I will have to leave.
        
        It's a nice space.
        
        I am tempted to think that nice things don't last long. Perhaps this has always been an underlying thought of mine. When I've felt that I don't belong to nice places with nice things, while part of the feeling was because too many things and too much space is overwhelming to me, it was not because I did not believe I deserved it. I have always found that notion of being worthy, of earning and deserving to be unfair, and after living in a foreign country where I was subjected to extreme poverty and the immense excess of a thriving country, there is no convincing me of anyone's or anything's worth, or value. If things had inherent value, red carpets wouldn't be collecting dust as they're stacked year after year at the bottom of a stairwell. If people had inherent value, I wouldn't have to spell out every bad thing I've ever lived through or lived with for people to send me a message, and even then, they sent their condolences and not a response more.
        
        I feel awkward. It doesn't mean I am awkward, but I hear so many embarrassed and concerned about being awkward. Awkward because they don't know what to say, awkward because they're not familiar with social norms, awkward because they don't perceive social cues. The opposite of amazing isn't awkward. People who know what to say or have something to say to other's pain and suffering, to diffuse the situation, to change the topic, can be called amazing, but their opposite isn't awkward. I don't even know what awkward is.
        
        What I know are simple and universal truths that in application seem to mean nothing.
        
        No one has inherent value or worth.
        
        No one is or becomes or was awkward.
        
        Who a person is has little, if anything, to do with what they do, what they like or care about. What a person is consists of all of that, all the labels and tags that can be ascribed to them. That is what they are, and we are inclined to use it as evidence of who, unknowingly confusing who with what, the same way that many do not realize that they confuse liking someone's work with liking them. Only once it comes into question, when they have to separate the two notions, is there any chance of realizing it, but even then, they don't because to think something is not thinking about something, which is not thinking about thinking either.
        
        And here I've gone back to my constantly ruminating explanations of human nature and psyche.
        
        I'm always trying to explain—to develop a model that will explain any and all of human nature, something to answer what is and what isn't human, what is specific to nation, community, the individual, and what is a facet of being. Such thinking instantly distances me from my own feelings and thoughts, and it is the basis of my opinions, whatever few I have. It's another example of the separation between me and the other, me and everyone else.
        
        Perhaps I should go back. Not 'dear stranger'.
        
        As I walk down a seemingly familiar hall, my fingers trace the lines scratched into the wall. The lines have torn through the wall paper, chipping off the paint underneath and leaving deep impressions in the wood as they spell out my name. The air is not musky or filled with dust, but the carpet has been ripped away, leaving the rotting, unsmoothed floorboards exposed. I am not afraid of falling. As I pass, I peer into the holes where light does not touch and expect to see hundreds of tiny pairs of eyes peering back at me. There are none.
        
        I spin about from one step to the next, looking at the sea green walls. The wallpaper of transparent sea animal silhouettes was not evenly applied. There are air bubbles, overlapping corners and empty spaces showing only the teal paint beneath. After a moment, the lights resume their shell-shaped covers, but I'm not even sure they were shaped like clamshells before. It seems familiar, a long endless hallway that I always seem to return to, only it's not. There was an end before. There was an end a number of times before. There is no end now.
        
        I look ahead and there is only a white wall that despite being a few steps and a leap within arm's reach never draws any closer. Even as my fingers return to the scratching of my name, I reach the beginning, only to start back at the end, heading ever forward towards a white wall I cannot reach. I keep walking, staring at the white wall. My fingers follow the curves and loops. I glance at the scratches and imagine going into one of those loops like falling into wonderland.
        
        What a funny idea.
        
        I could do it, but I would rather not and return to looking, walking towards the white wall. I keep my eyes on the white wall, willing myself not to look away, not to think, not to wonder, staring at the white wall. The white wall. There is only the white wall, even as I feel the scratches beneath my fingers or lower my gaze. In my mind, in my focus, there is only that white wall ahead of me.
        
        But then, it's right in front of me, a breath away. I have reached the white wall and look towards my hand, and see the corner of the walls, where they join. The hall has ended. Releasing a heavy breath and looking ahead, my eyes wander over the surface an inch in front of my nose. I cannot smell the paint or the wood behind it, but I could touch the tip of my nose to the wall without leaning much forward. My fingers trace the impression of the corner, feeling the crevice where the walls intersect. In the impression, it's as if I'm still tracing the lines. I can still feel the chipped paint underneath, though the paint remains intact in the corner.
        
        What am I to do?
        
        Walk the other way?
        
        For some reason, I don't see another white wall behind me. There have been less than a handful of times I've turned back and walked the other way, and each time, there was something there, not this endless hallway or ever expanding corridor. There were windows, there were tables with flowers in vases, there were doors, and actual corridors. If I turned back now, I could not conceive what I would see. There was all that space behind me, but it just occurred to me, there might be none. I never looked back, so how was I to know that there wasn't a back wall following my steps, less than a foot behind me. How close did something have to be to feel that it was there?
        
        I feel nothing against my back and nothing close to my back, but I didn't know how close something had to be for me to feel it, so there could be a wall right behind me. For all I knew, I was standing in a box with only space to my left and right. I wouldn't look left and right.
        
        This white wall was everything to me, yet I was afraid to touch it. What if I touched this white wall in front of me and it disappeared?
        
        What if I fell and I kept falling?
        
        I saw darkness, and why that tortured the me standing in front of the wall was puzzling because for that moment, I could see myself. I could see myself standing at the white wall, thinking about the wall disappearing and becoming infinite, impenetrable darkness.
        
        But darkness does not scare me. The me who stood at the wall started to cry like a child who realized they had nowhere to go. I thought of the white wall, of standing right at the white wall, so that it would be me standing there, and I focused on what I could smell. My fingers touched the wall, traced its surface. The wall remained. It is me standing here, and I looked up to the corner between the wall and the ceiling. The ceiling was white.
        
        Perhaps I should wonder.
        
        I could feel my breathing was shallow. In all honesty, I feel like watching a movie now. As I stared up at the corner between the wall and the ceiling, I wondered. I wondered why, if I could, and why not.
        
        I could feel the wetness building beneath my eyes.
        
        I could be the one crying, but not yet. I wondered why, if I could, and why not.
        
        I wondered why, if I could, and why not.
        
        The first thing that came to mind were her words: "You're too stupid to do it. Do something you would be good at."
        
        Did she say "you're too stupid" or "you're not smart enough"?
        
        It's as if she said both. "You don't have the right mind for it," that I know she said. "Do something you would be good at." I never had an answer then, and I cannot understand why we were standing there, right out of the corridor, when she said it, but I have a feeling that as usual, we were crossing paths. She was holding a mug. Maybe we weren't crossing paths. That might have been where I stopped and listened as she moved about the kitchen, then she might have passed me to head for her office back down the corridor. I know why I'm confused.
        
        My mind only has the scenery, the layout. Only that is for certain, even if I suspect, it is being recreated from my most recent visit. What is getting all confused is our positions relative to one another, her movements, where she was going, what she was wearing. I am only most certain about the words: "Do something you would be good at" and "You don't have the right mind for it."
        
        What I know is they weren't said at the same time.
        
        What I know is that if I looked in my journal, my past self recalled it all with greater clarity.
        
        What I know is that my confusion is tampering with my capacity to remember.
        
        Am I too stupid, or not smart enough?
        
        She falls down to curl up on her haunches, hands to her head, the me in that house hearing those words. I see her. I remember crying like that, curled up, arms folded beneath my chest and legs, unable to fall to the floor or to stand. It's not because of the words or the memories.
        
        It's because I can't remember.
        
        Am I too stupid, or not smart enough?
        
        What's worse is that in this confusion, my mind is shutting off, shutting down, locking floodgates. With a clearer mind, I could remember. Like this, everything is being reconstructed from association and knowledge of consistencies—consistencies of scenery, behaviors, light and furniture. All this confusion places me in a kaleidoscope of memories. I sit beside myself, looking at all the colors, the fragments of different lighting glued together like the edges of jigsaw puzzle pieces, and beside me, she is shivering, her breath shaking. She is no longer crying, but she remains curled up, feeling as if she cannot become small enough, as if she cannot disappear, even if she happened to want to.
        
        I feel a hand grasp my shoulder. Though I imagined tensing up, I didn't and look over. She has her head bent, face down, hair acting like a dark curtain, and her pale hand grips my shoulder. I look at her and wait for something to change—for her to scare me. I wait for the guttural croaking, the moans, the shrill screams, but she is still and motionless.
        
        I dare to wonder: are we okay?
        
        I imagine her jerking her head like a skipped record, revealing one piercing eye from between the strands of her dark hair, but she has not moved. She remains still and motionless. Releasing my breath, I look away and reach for the hand on my shoulder. As I look up to the kaleidoscope surrounding us, I feel my finger tips touch her hand and for a moment, it bothers me that her hand felt like a corpse's. I remembered touching the hand of the old woman in the coffin. I left the procession and cried in the parking lot, hiding beside the tire of some car, not knowing how to cry or how to stop, wiping at my face, holding my hair away, crying and choked for air. The hand on my shoulder felt like that old woman's hand.
        
        I wondered how people were able to touch the dead, to kiss their forehead. I remember watching people doing that before I drew closer.
        
        Was I in a line, I don't remember.
        
        Were we standing aside and the one with me waited to see if I wanted to venture forward, I don't remember.
        
        There is so much I can't remember about all the things in my memories.
        
        It's no wonder.
        
        She falls against my shoulder, curling into herself. The hand on my shoulder had been withdrawn. Now, she holds herself. When I look over, I still can't see her face. All I see is the back of my head as we sit here in the kaleidoscope.
        
        Do I wish I could remember?
        
        I have wished it, but before I could try any techniques for remembering, I believe that I can't, so I don't try. I don't believe I can anymore. Instead, here are my memories. In these words. I store my memories in moments like this, whether in my journal, as Sm Joker, in notes and letters, or stories. Pieces of me in everything that I write. My memories are here.
        
        Am I too stupid...
        
        Or am I not smart enough...
        
        I wish the answer was neither. I wish she had believed in me, had tried to believe in me, that she had taught me more, mentored me, perhaps supported me.
        
        I don't think she realized what she had done. It's not as if she would remember either. She often forgets or will not admit that she has ever said something in opposition of her present morals. So even if I asked her, "Am I too stupid, or am I not smart enough," her answer would be diplomatic, favorable to her own self image. She would neither clarify nor explain, not unless I had proof.
        
        And what happened to the proof?
        
        Were they there in all those pages I allowed to burn?
        
        Are they somewhere in all the gigabytes of notes, old stories, the images and scans of all those notebooks and journals I had?
        
        Why is it that even though they were the ones to threaten me that they would burn it all, it was me who ended up burning them? I allowed my own papers to burn. I said "last day of school" like it was some kind of celebration or honor, and so the pages were burned. Why me? I burned my own memories.
        
        I feel a hand rest on my arm and look down to see that while one arm remains wrapped around herself, she has reached over with the other to touch mine.
        
        Am I...
        
        She squeezes. I suppose it is time I stopped going in circles with my thoughts. It's not a matter of getting anywhere. We are tired. Not just her. It is enough, isn't it?
        
        I look up. The kaleidoscope formed from the memories of different lighting resembles what I would imagine the skin of Frankenstein's monster would look like. All the hues of white, cream and soft yellow. The light of morning, afternoon, sunset and evening. I wonder if people ever appreciate the kaleidoscope of their own memories, to see all the colors, the lighting of a single place across time, at different times of the day, during different scenes. To see them all, yet not too closely, to see the kaleidoscope of your own home.
        
        Home. That's why I'm here, isn't it?
        
        I have never had a home again. I had spaces: the mat beside the back doors and the long sofa facing the TV. Although I remember lying on the kitchen floor and the living room floor, pacing between the areas day and night, when I used to sleep on the bed in my room, when I used to sleep next to my mom, why are none of these mine?
        
        I have never had a home again, except perhaps the apartment I just moved from. After a year and a half, it was my home. Two years later, I have moved again, and so, in my mind, it wasn't. Home seems to be something stationary, static, something that lasts and stands the test of time. When I heard that the other house, the other place I grew up and the last that my family owned from my childhood, was going to be sold in a few years, I cried for a moment. I mourned it for a moment. Home, that home, stopped being home then.
        
        When I left the states nine years ago, I knew I was looking for a home. I wanted to find a place for myself, but all I found was another hell. For three years, the shadow of that hell loomed over me until one day, I found it was in the past. I had finally walked out of the shadow. However, I am not so naïve to think it has not found its place in the recesses of my mind and thoughts. All that is needed is another trigger.
        
        Like the time I went home to the other house to stay for two months and all the nightmares came out, lying beside me, watching me from the closet, crawling along the walls and staring at me from the side of my bed. The men who used my body for their own pleasure kept appearing and speaking. I kept slashing them, cutting them up into pieces, and I'd only get minutes of relief. As people talked to me, I would experience the memories of them yelling at or lecturing me, moving around me, the memories playing and overlapping each other and reality. I slept during the day, all hours of the day. I stopped eating. Hell.
        
        My home was hell.
        
        All I need is another trigger, and every hell I have ever been in will come back. I take my medication every night as I should, so that the hallucinations and the paranoia don't overtake me. I'm scared to go one day without them. In turn, I'm scared of running out of the birth control and the allergy medicine, but those are lesser evils really. Four pills. I'm used to taking four pills.
        
        Why is all this on my mind?
        
        The calm before the storm, I've heard that phrase and thought of it a lot. The eye of the hurricane. Do I really think something bad will happen to me, amidst all this loss by others? This was a thought, and while the thought scares me, we know it's unfounded. I look over and she is not bothered. While I feel a sudden pit in my stomach, I look at her, at the top of my own head, and I know this is just a concern to latch onto to express my concern. It is not what I am actually concerned about.
        
        I already know what I am concerned about. Home. The job I have always wanted. Memories and triggers coming to get me. They are all connected. I have enumerated how; if not all here, in other writings. So this is the curse of a mind wandering.
        
        It's fun.
        
        I still have the feeling of a pit in my stomach, but it doesn't bother me. I'm not scared, or worried. So it seems there is a lot ahead. Think we'll make it?
        
        I can see her sinister smile, even though I do not look at her. I am still looking at the kaleidoscope surrounding us. Her smile is understandable. We will always make it, and as always, we'll trudge our way through, coming out with more scratches and scars to tell another story. I hope it's not another hell.
        
        Not another hell.
        
        Have I had enough for one lifetime, or do I need to go through all seven, or nine, levels before I can live my life without fearing another hell to come?
        
        Yet another worry. Yet another concern. Yet another fear.
        
        Here we go.`

        text: `Two thousand years ago, Halloween was a celtic festival celebrated in the UK, Ireland and northern France called Samhain (summer's end). It was seen as the day when the worlds of the living and dead would collide as winter was a time of darkness, cold and death. To ward off the otherworldly beings, people danced around a sacred bonfire in costumes and brought this fire back to their homes with torches to light their hearths, protecting them from otherworldly beings and the harsh winter.

        On Sep 29, I stopped by the supermarket and saw Halloween decorations taking two whole aisles. Golden Week, China's National Holiday, was the next day and Mid-Autumn festival was just a few days ago but all the mooncake was gone. Just the day before, my friend and I heard Christmas music playing in a cafe and talked about Thanksgiving in the US. What a strange time of year. Like it happens all at once.
        
        What Do You Do When You're Scared?
        
        What scares me most is the sudden awareness of shadows. I imagine late at night, when I've stayed up late reading on my cell, laughing and groaning about the plights of the characters, that while I wave my phone about and laugh, that a shadow tears herself out of the wall and clings to the back of my headboard. She slinks up the back like a lizard then peers over the top as I continue ruminating to myself but because she's a shadow, I'd feel nothing more than a chill as she snakes her arms through mine and rests her head on my shoulder. As I lie against the headboard and think to myself, she'd crawl over me, grinning to herself and only once my phone was off, once my eyes adjusted to the dark would I see her crawling and lying over me.
        
        Her head turns from front to back, fixed grin and black eyes staring at me. The worst part was not seeing her but seeing her and feeling her do it all over again, latching onto the back of the headboard, slithering up and over, and resting her head on my shoulder with that fixed grin and unblinking black-eyed stare.
        
        So I did what I always do. Pretending there was nothing, I fixed the blanket over my body, positioned my pillows behind and beside me, debated whether to check my phone, half out of fear, half out of questionable reason. As I laid down and pulled up the blanket, I saw her, felt her and became aware of her mouthing and inaudible gurgles. So I closed my eyes.`

        "No." She stopped and held up her notes. As if counting points, she recited the terms under her breath.
        
        Jesse groaned and swung around, only to turn back. He could see her muttering as quickly as she could. "Please!"

        She started to grin and reached her final point, slamming down the paper as she rose, pushing her chair back into Jesse's side. He cried out with a yelp. She did not notice until she looked at him. He held his side, frowning.
        
        "You okay?"
        
        Jesse nodded. He looked over at her. "You got it?"
        
        "I think I'm good."
        
        He stared at her, not knowing what to make of her, and then held out his hand. Maddy reached into her pocket, pulled out her wallet and gave him a five.
        
        Jesse folded it and stuffed it in his pocket. "You know. I might as well become a professional whiner if you're gonna have me keep doing this. What are you going to do next year?"
        
        Maddy cocked her head. "What you mean?"

        "That's neglect!"
        
        "No, no, no—it's okay. We'll babysit."
        
        Jesse stared at her, exasperated. "You want to convince other people to give us their baby for a couple of hours, just so you can neglect it and finish your studies?"
        
        Maddy thought about it and started nodding to herself. "Yeah. Yeah, sounds good."
        
        "Uh, Maddy?"
        
        She peered at him.

        "Oh."

        "You just need the noise right?"

        Maddy cocked her head. "Maybe?"
        
        "A hundred." He held out his hand.
        
        She balked. "What you mean a hundred?"

It was so long ago, so far into their past, how was she supposed to remember, but as that thought occurred to her, she slapped her own ego because she knew, she did remember that it wasn't that one devastating event. She had been there and witnessed its ripple effect for years breaking his mom with debt, his brothers with grief and chaos, and he ran to her to help him laugh again. How could she forget? But she did.

        She grabbed for his arm and cried, "I'm sorry," even if it disturbed the rest of the café. "I'm sorry."
        
        Mark looked at her. He didn't look angry, just sad. "Yeah. I know. But not right now. Let me." He turned from her. "Let me get over it first."
        
        Her hands fell away and she watched him go. She felt like crying, she felt the stares, but it did not feel as if she were the right one to cry. Sitting back, she looked over the table, over their coffee cups, his pastry, the crumbs, and in her head, there was so much that it was nothing. If someone asked, she could not expound to them all that she was thinking or feeling or remembering or imagining. She reached behind her, grabbed her bag from the chair and stood, heading out the way Mark had gone, but while he went left, she would go right.`

        "Dude. Random question."

You're not that smart when it comes to people, but at the same time, you're really fucking smart. Like, you can see people struggle and you can tell why and how to help them—right? Isn't that why you wish?"

        Elle choked and laughed. He hugged his middle, he grinned. What the fuck, he thought and grinned, grinning and grinning, smiling to himself and at his friend. Even if his eyes were closed, he saw Seph, he saw their face and heard everything they ever said and he kept laughing. All the mirth just bubbled out all throughout him and it felt like he might float if he didn't hold himself, but even as he held himself, he was shaking, he was breaking, he was grinning. What the fuck!
        
        Seph watched Elle laugh and felt a smile that did not manifest on their face. Looking away, Seph listened to the silence, to the rustling, to the awkward, stilted breathing of their friend, and a smile crept into their eyes.

        text: `She stumbled down the street, crying in her head. There was a scream inside her and she wanted to scream, destroy the silence of the quaint houses and cobble streets, the romantic street lamps and the starry sky. She wanted to cry hot, sticky tears. She wanted to lift her head and scream as if she might shatter every window and glass.

        But no one saw her stumbling down the street.
        
        No one saw me.
        
        I thought of all the eyes, the peeking eyes hiding behind curtains and shutters, but I dared not look to find no one watching. No one would be watching at this hour, and even if they did, even as I stumbled over my feet, I knew I wouldn't seem as helpless or lost or broken as I felt. Every time that I can remember ever being sick or crying in front of people, they didn't know I was crying and just took my word that I was sick.
        
        I was the only one watching myself, watching the woman walking down the street and crying more than she actually was, hearing her scream a scream so deafening that there was no wind, no silence, no clicks and clacks on the cobble stones. Somehow, I always came back to a place like this. Without looking, I knew the streets and houses so picturesque spread across rolling hills overlooking a vast ocean. There was a bay ahead, a bridge crossing it to an islet that fit just a castle that seemed more like a forest than an arrangement of towers and turrets, and against my will, I lifted my head and looked towards the bay, where the light was changing on the waters. The sun was just over the horizon. It was going to rise and just then, I heard the birds. How had I missed them?
        
        I imagined them swooping through the air, their haunting whistles echoing into the silence of the hills like arrows on a wind. Yet again, another day, another daybreak. Why was I always on the precipice of another beginning, another chance?
        
        Another life?
        
        I could see the woman close her eyes with a pained cringe, a twisting of her lips and nose, and a shutter of her chest and shoulders as she gave in to crying. Step by step, ever moving forward, I saw her stop and hug herself. Though I imagined her lowering to her knees and bending over the cobble stones, holding onto herself, gripping harder and harder, she didn't. She stayed behind me, standing in the middle of the street, holding herself. I almost looked back, only to close my eyes and hope to fall over. Step by step, ever forward I moved towards that bridge, that castle. Called by the trees, the towers, the stone bridge, ever forward towards a place I have never reached before.
        
        Home.
        
        That's what it was. Home. When I opened my eyes, I saw the bay, the bridge, the street lamps, the castle, the brightening sky. How funny to yearn for a place I would never stay. I was supposed to be thinking, pondering, deciphering, but here I was again.
        
        Is the future a place I can never reach?
        
        Is home a place I can never have?
        
        I was supposed to be thinking of rules, the beliefs I've lived by. I was supposed to think of how to say goodbye, how to stop, how to take a break.
        
        I know: So long as you focus on your objective, you will never achieve it. Only if you think of how and focus on how will you one day reach the finish line.
        
        But it's awfully tempting, don't you think? Out of fear, concern, worry, anxiety, pain, when asked "what are you most worried about", all hopes and plans get swept away for one poignant, frightening moment of comprehension, probably so fleeting that it's never realized or settled in flesh as disturbed and uneasy. Should you answer? What superstition, what jinx or charm or fairytale will you call on?
        
        I had charms once. I believed in jinxes and fortune. I was told to believe not in coincidence but a grand design, but now, now, now.
        
        Now.
        
        I see her reach for tomorrow, holding out her hand to the bridge and the castle and the bay. She stumbles step by step, ever moving forward, but they lied. Tomorrow never comes. I've been waiting. For nearly two decades now, since I was that preteen girl lying on the floor in pain, praying to god, making deals with the devil, wishing she was free, wishing she could feel happiness and sadness and anger—anything but the pain and the waiting. For nearly two decades, I've been waiting.
        
        Finally, I fall to my knees. I stop and fall forward, colliding with cold cobble stones, the bumpy surface of a picturesque street.
        
        Finally, I'm not watching her fall. I've fallen, and finally, I cry, but the tears aren't hot or sticky. There's no scrunching of my face or the sting in my eyes. The tears collect on my lashes and drip onto the stones beneath me.
        
        Finally, I have fallen.
        
        Can tomorrow finally come?`

        text: `“I wish I'd known,” she mused, thinking aloud with her chin on her hand, resting against the table in the middle of their kitchen. Her husband was in the entrance, standing just out of the light. When she looked at him, she did not see him. Then he stepped through the entryway into the dim lighting of the kitchen. He was wearing a blue jumpsuit, his sleeves and pants covered in blood with splatters across his chest. Looking at her, he sighed. His shoulders relaxed as he shook his head. Seeing her husband, the woman sat back. She took a moment, swallowing thickly and closed her eyes, pinching the bridge of her nose, saying “Give me a moment.”

        Her husband slunk to the chair beside her. She opened her eyes and looked down at the floor to see if he was tracking any dirt or blood, but there was none. He was in his socks, shoes discarded. He slid out the chair beside her, the legs dragged on the floor. Shifting about, he plopped down and slumped forward, folding his arms on the table, lowering his head.
        
        The woman stared at her husband, studying him. Even if the lighting was dim, there was nothing he could hide. “Did they get away,” she wondered.
        
        He shook his head. “Put up a fight. A good one.”
        
        “But they're dead.”
        
        “Yeah,” he said, sitting up and sighed, looking out the window across from him. There seemed to be a full moon tonight. Moonlight bathed their kitchen sink.
        
        His wife's eyes narrowed on him. He glanced at her but could not look at her long. His gaze fell. She straightened, folding her arms over her chest and frowned at him. “So why're you so tired?”
        
        He smiled, a laugh under his breath. “They fought back,” he said, “Isn't that enough?”
        
        His wife's lashes fluttered with disbelief. Her expression remained sour. The way she looked at him, it was imperial and he loved it so much. “You're not lying to me,” she said, “Now why are you tired?”
        
        He closed his eyes, laughing under his breath and shook his head. “Honey,” he spoke softly and turned to her, “I'm not tired. I'm just. Confused.”
        
        Her brows furrowed together. “What has you so confused,” she wondered, unfolding her arms, and sat forward. “They're dead, aren't they?”
        
        “Of course they're dead,” he said, tossing his hand out in a gesture that it was inconsequential but his wife was more observant than he was, even smarter, and he was tired. He was more than tired. As he said, he was confused. Looking at his wife, he reached for her hand on the table. She did not withdraw from him, she did not flinch. His beloved wife allowed him to pick up her hand and cradle it in his. Closing his eyes, he brought her hand to his face. He rubbed against her knuckles, smelled the perfume on her wrist. It was the one she wore every day. He bought it for her one year, four months and twenty-three days ago. “Why,” he whispered against her hand. He opened his eyes and gazed at his wife. She was studying him, brows furrowed, eyes dark and confused. As he looked at her, she met his gaze and he smiled, but the smile dimmed instantly. “Why do they insist on yelling at me, no one will ever love me?”
        
        His wife scoffed. A smile bloomed on her lips as she blinked and looked away, processing. Incredulous, he knew that was the word for her reaction. She did not pull her hand away but straightening, then leaning towards him, she said “They're saying that because they think you're a monster, you know that, don't you? Of course that would be one of the things they would yell at you.” He frowned and tilted his head, his confusion now apparent on his face. Shaking her head, looking at him, she sighed and explained, “You know there's that stereotype, that movie trope, of the killer with a troubled childhood, that in this fucked up expression of love or hate that they will destroy what they cannot have, destroy what has rejected them, destroy what they desire. You know.”
        
        He smiled. “How are you so smart?”
        
        His wife deadpanned. “You bastard. You just wanted to hear me say it.”
        
        He lowered her hand, laughing to himself, but he would not let go, stroking her fingers. Feeling that there was no ring, he stopped and remembered that this was his wife's right hand. He looked down and in her lap, he found her left hand, where she faithfully wore his ring. Stroking her hand, staring at her wedding band, he wondered, “Are the children asleep?”
        
        “Well, they're not dead, if that's what you're asking.”
        
        He looked at his wife. She looked bored as she stared off at nothing. “What do you think their reaction will be?”
        
        She looked at him and he looked at her eyes, the straightforward and honest gaze that he absolutely fell in love with. He smiled. When she rolled her eyes, he realized she had asked a question. He gave a wheezing laugh, seizing the chance to grab his wife's other hand and raise the two to his lips. Murmuring against them, he said, “Ask me again.”
        
        Worshipping her hands, he still felt the shift in the air and how her body moved when she straightened. “Never mind it,” she said. He chuckled and kissed her fingers. She looked away. As he lowered her hands, he heard her question in his head.
        
        “I imagine it'll either break them or change them.” His wife looked at him, a moment disoriented and then realizing what he was talking about. He did not look back at her though, stroking her fingers with his thumb and staring at the ring on her finger. “I doubt our children will inherit your courage.”
        
        “Courage?” At her tone, he looked up, unable to keep from smiling, seeing how his wife cocked her head with narrowed eyes, a look of disdain and condescension on her face. “You think this is courage?”
        
        He looked up and around. “Well I am a monster.”
        
        When he looked at his wife, she had deadpanned. “Define monster,” she said.
        
        He grinned. “This is why I love you.”
        
        She rolled her eyes. “No, you love me because you can absolutely be yourself with me and banter about it. It's a game to you and I am the only person you've met that plays willingly and without derision.”
        
        The man pursed his lips, a smile curling along them, nodding to himself. “That about sums it up, doesn't it.”
        
        His wife leaned in, looking between his eyes and his mouth. “You're finished, right? You cleaned up and everything?”
        
        The man rolled his eyes and sighed. His hold on his wife's hands loosened as if he were about to let go, only to tighten unconsciously. He was not aware but his wife was. She glanced down at their hands and knew he was holding onto her. She saw his ring covered in blood and the stains just within the cuff of his sleeve. “Why did you want children?”
        
        He frowned and looked at her, the question taking a moment to register. “What?”
        
        She lifted her head and looked back at him. “Why did you want children? Our lives would be so much easier. Not to mention.” She sat up, regarding him with a tilt of her head. “It's not as if they'll ever play your game.”
        
        “You never know.”
        
        “It's not hereditary,” she asserted, “and it's not as if you've taken the time to teach any of them or that any of them have demonstrated such an inclination.”
        
        “Not that they would,” he whispered. She heard.
        
        “Exactly.”
        
        He lifted his gaze to his wife's and studied her. “Shall I go kill them?”
        
        She stared back at him and smiled. “I don't think either of us wants that.”
        
        He nodded. “You'd be right. So why do you ask?”
        
        He stared at her and she stared at him. They kept their hands clasped together, leaning towards one another, their breathing and likely the beating of their hearts working in tandem. “Do you remember what you promised me?”
        
        He smiled. “Which promise, I've promised you many things.”
        
        “The first,” she said, “The first true promise you gave me, when there were no more lies, no more hiding. When I saw you, do you remember what you promised me?”
        
        His eyes narrowed but a smile tugged on his lips. “Of course I remember. I promised you.”
        
        “You promised me,” she interrupted, which surprised him and made him uncertain and suspicious. He wondered if his wife was scared. “Did you clean up?”
        
        He shook his head, gaze falling to their hands. “I cleaned up.”
        
        “But,” she interrupted, “You have walked into this house and no one would mistake what you've done. You did not clean up.”
        
        He took a breath and looked at himself, taking note of all the blood on his sleeves, pants and the splatters across his torso. With a nod to himself, he looked at his wife. “You're right.” He watched her searching his eyes and all he could think was how beautiful she was. “I guess I was thrown off by that. By what that woman had yelled at me.”
        
        “It affected you that much.”
        
        He shrugged, thinking and not able to muster a sentence from his thoughts. Feeling one of his wife's hands slip out from his, he jerked forward to look at them, only to feel her hand comb through his hair, grazing across his ear, and then cupping the side of his head. He lifted his gaze to hers and was met with determination and insistence. How he loved the way she looked at him, the cold analytical stare that studied him, saw him and every detail, never hiding from him or lying to him.
        
        “I'm right here,” she said.
        
        He broke out in a smile. He closed his eyes and leaned into her hand with a sigh. “I know you are.” In the darkness behind his eyes, he found the memory of when he walked in, hearing her say 'I wish I'd known.' As he opened his eyes, he heard the woman yelling at him that it was no wonder no one ever loved him and no one ever could. He remembered how adamant that woman was for him to hear those last words, even as she should have been screaming in pain and terror. In her final moments, she screamed at the top of her lungs, “You're alone!” That was the moment he swung an axe down to shut her up, since sawing off her limbs had not kept her from yelling at him. He looked at his wife and wondered, “What were you thinking when I came in?”
        
        She looked back at him, messing with the strands of his hair, grasping and following them to their tips. She was so focused on the gesture but he knew she was thinking. His wife often fixated on lines and while she never made any nervous gestures, if she was touching him, then the nervous gestures would manifest.
        
        “I was thinking,” she muttered and continued teasing strands of his hair, “That in tv shows and movies, it's always, if only I had known.” She looked at him. “You know, the wife never knows what her husband has done and she's. She gets hunted by reporters for all the potential reasons anyone might be interested in serial killers, even to sympathize and treating her like another victim. Usually she is actually, but that's what I was thinking.” She looked at him again. “It's only sunk in now that I'll never say those words.”
        
        She smiled at him but it looked pained.
        
        “I wonder if I'm your babysitter.” His eyes widened and he stifled a laugh, kissing her fingers, only to chuckle to himself against her hand. She continued. “Am I your accomplice, your jail warden, your hostage?” He frowned and raised his head, but whatever he felt or had thought of saying, the moment he saw her calm, confident stare, he was silent. “What am I,” she said, “Who will I be to you, if you're ever caught?”
        
        His eyes narrowed. “I promised you,” he said and kissed her knuckles, gripping her hand in his, “I will never be caught.”
        
        She kissed his forehead. He froze. “You better not,” she whispered, “Or I will kill you before the cops get here.”
        
        He grinned and lifted his head. His wife was pulling away from him, sliding her hand out. He watched as she hoisted herself up, standing with her straight posture, head held high. When she looked down at him, it was as if she were looking down the length of her nose. His imperial wife. He would worship her. She looked him over. “You coming to bed?”
        
        He looked himself over, planting a hand on the table and pushed himself up. Standing at her side, he slid an arm around her and they left the kitchen. As they were walking through the dark living room, she told him, “You better be careful from now on.”
        
        He hummed. It was a question.
        
        “Our youngest has nightmares. She might be awake one of these days when you come in and if you come in looking like that.”
        
        He turned his head and kissed the top of his wife's head. “I'll be careful,” he said.
        
        “Ten times more,” she said and glared up at him.
        
        He smiled. “Ten times more.”
        
        “You're lucky.” They made it to the door of their room. He noticed his wife hurried to open the door and usher him in, not even bothering with the light. “She was up earlier.”
        
        His wife closed the door behind them.
        
        With her back to the door, moonlight streaming in through the blinds on their windows, she watched him move between the shadows and light. When he turned to her, seeing the gaze that was always watching him, able to see him even in the darkest hour, he smiled, his face half cast in shadow. “Do you like it,” he wondered.
        
        His wife cocked her head, regarding him. Gently, she wandered away from the door, drawn to him, approaching with slow, deliberate steps. As she stopped in front of him, their faces inches apart, the light catching her pupils which were watching him, studying him closely, he felt his heart starting to race. It was an excitement similar to the kill, but it was its own thrill. He bent his head down so that their lips were less than an inch apart as he met her unerring gaze. Just as he was about to close the distance, she said, “I don't. But you like it, and that's all that matters.”
        
        Could a killer's heart sing? He wanted to ask the woman he killed what she thought of that but he was fine without an answer because his wife always knew what no one else could. His wife was all-knowing.
        
        “I love you,” he breathed.
        
        She smiled. “Don't forget to soak your clothes and take a shower. You smell like sweat.”
        
        She turned away, but he caught her and held her against him. “Now you're covered in evidence. You need to clean up too.”
        
        He could not see it but he knew his wife rolled her eyes at that. Reaching down, he lifted her legs and carried her bridal style to their adjoining bathroom. She wrapped her arms around him and relaxed against him. He could not help but wonder what that woman would say to this. In his head, he imagined it would have confounded her and the whole world, jaws dropped, mouths covered, the disgust and confusion. They were in a world all their own, he and the most amazing woman, if not the only amazing woman, in the whole world.
        
        He was so happy, and what would a dead woman say to that?`

        text: `"What are you supposed to do with a headache?" Ellis groaned and flopped back on their pillow, only to regret it as their head seemed to ache and throb even more, and was that a touch of lightheadedness?

        At their feet, Judith and Oliver sat on the floor, their heads spinning slowly in tandem and as they rocked from side to side, they joined in chorus, "What to do, what to do, oh what to do with a headache!" Judith threw out her arms, Oliver ducked and whined. Judith laughed in pain, and Ellis kicked her. A cry turned into a moan as Judith fell back. Oliver remained bent over, whining under his breath.
        
        "What. The. Hell."
        
        "I don't know!!"
        
        Oliver groaned, just barely letting his head lift before letting it fall and rocking side to side, and crying under his breath.
        
        "Was it a phone, or tv, or fuck!"
        
        Judith laughed, only to cry and press her palms against her temples, hoping the pressure might relieve the ache.
        
        "Fuck!"
        
        Judith both cried and laughed, meagerly telling Ellis to shut the hell up.
        
        Oliver lowered to his side and crawled away, curling up against the wall as if he could disappear or squeeze himself into some mouse hole. He just had to find one.
        
        Ellis squirmed from side to side, begging, crying, moaning, groaning, and whining. "Oh make it fuckin' go away."
        
        "I need sleeping pills."
        
        "Where are they?"
        
        "I can't remember."
        
        "Oh fuck!"
        
        Oliver shook and shivered, rocking himself.
        
        Judith began hitting her head, anything, anything that might help. Even more pain, a different pain, just something else!
        
        Ellis moaned and moaned.
        
        Judith opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling. The pain, the pain, the pain. She moved her head in circles, feeling only the pain, the throbbing, the aching, the pain, pain, pain. She couldn't keep her head still as if the pain were just a little more manageable if she just kept bobbing. Then she laughed. "Red."
        
        "What." Ellis snarled and glared over at Judith who didn't see, couldn't see, just kept moving her head.
        
        "A story. Red."
        
        Oliver hummed to himself as if he might be meditating. Ellis shot up, only to stop, eyes wide, mouth gaping, the pain so intense, the darkness closing in, and with a silent scream, they lowered themselves closer to Oliver who continued humming and humming like a monk's continuous Om. "What's Red," Ellis muttered.
        
        "A story."
        
        "I know, I got that. Story about."
        
        Judith's breathing was shorter. She couldn't move her head anymore. Resting back, she could only breathe, from breath to breath.
        
        "Hey." Ellis propped themselves up and tried to look back to see Judith, but only with a long, wide yawn did they manage to keep the pain away long enough to look at Judith. "Hey. Hey! Hey? Judith?" They craned their neck and shifted to look closer. As they leaned over, they noticed Judith's shallow breaths and closed eyes. "Judith?"
        
        "It hurts."
        
        "Yeah."
        
        "It hurts."
        
        "Yeah."
        
        Oliver continued humming.
        
        Ellis rested their head and cried.
        
        "Red," Judith muttered and opened her eyes. "Where everything, everyone is red, red. So red. It drove them crazy. Cause they only saw red."
        
        Ellis whined.
        
        "I think. I think I. I understand. Red. It's all red."
        
        "Fucking hurts."

        text: `She swayed with each step, hands out, prim and manicured, keeping her balance, as she wandered away, moving her skirts and wisps of her hair rising with the passing breeze. As I watched her walk in her short, stumpy burgundy heels, that sky blue long skirt, the wide leather belt at her waist, and the craning of her slender neck, as she looked into the sunlight shining at the front of the pagoda, I thought the light could take her. Maybe that's what the Greeks saw, when they imagined Apollo, or some other god riding on a blinding white chariot swooping down to take some maiden away. That's all I saw.

        What could be heard was lost. I doubted she realized she'd dropped to a whisper, and as the breeze blew past her, it took her words in lieu of the hair and woman who seemed as if she could disappear that easily. I reclined along the wooden bench and thought of the image of her, her craning neck and the light that obscured her face.
        
        "Marybelle?"
        
        I looked over and she was facing me, breaking that ethereal spell. She should turn back to the light and disappear.
        
        "Marybelle?"
        
        She was concerned. "What?"
        
        Her expression shifted. "Don't you ever want something?" She was...sad.
        
        "How about a better name?"
        
        She cracked a smile, but it didn't reach her eyes. The light shined on her hair and at her back as if a man was joining us at her side. "Well," she said and wandered back to an adjacent bench. As she sat, brushing down the sides of her skirt, she maintained that pleasant smile, yet looked down at the ground, thinking. "I think it would be a good change for us. Maybe."
        
        What would be?
        
        She was looking away, out towards the gardens and light.
        
        "If we could just get away from here."
        
        I glanced at the gardens, all the bland and obscure green, the red and blue flowers, and the stone paved paths weaving between hedge walls and trailing bushes. Picturesque, painted in wide and careless strokes, the light made it all idyllic, or it made it so for people like her. I could see the color. At the same time, I couldn't. The light was too bright, it bleached the colors of the garden, leaving everything burnt and white.
        
        "I think the shores would be a nice place to go."
        
        The shores? The light cast on the water was even more blinding. There were no colors left but the red-edged darkness and the spots behind closed eyelids. It was worse.
        
        "Or maybe the fields."
        
        Flowers and pollen, more sunlight and sweat, mud between the toes, and a sky as blue and wide as the unseen sea. Maybe.
        
        "Maybe. Oh! How about the forest?"
        
        "The forest?"
        
        She turned to me, surprised. Her wonder was gone. She was only dreaming for one, but she smiled anyway. "Yes, the forest. What do you think?"
        
        She was only dreaming for one.  "I think..."
        
        She stood and made her way to the front of the pagoda, looking into the light. I could imagine, as she rested one hand against one of the columns, that as she leaned forward, the light caressed the skin of her cheeks, fingers moving, stroking, tracing the lines and shape of her face. She could never stay away from him too long. Every lover got jealous and every friend felt secondary to the light and his demands of her. She reached up, rising on the balls of her feet, and reached to the sun and sky as the breeze blew wisps of her hair up.
        
        At any moment, it always seemed as if she could be taken far away, gone, disappeared, lost. Gone, far away, disappeared, lost. At any moment.
        
        "Marybelle?"
        
        I'm here. Are you?`

He would close his eyes but a moment and see the lights shining on a glamourous man with big hair and studded mantle, see the sun and trees and warm breeze as a man reclined on a blanket, next to a wicker basket, see the old men playing banjos and harmonicas, laughing, clapping, stomping their feet among flickering lights as couples danced in circles and glasses crashed against the walls, see the solo musician playing long, soulful notes on his saxophone, framed by the spotlight, and when he opened his eyes, he saw the needle, thread and his canvas, and continued to hum.

        When pattering feet flew past the room, he cocked his head and paused for the moment. Hearing heavy-booted feet, he glanced up just as another man appeared, burly with a beard and mop that obscured everything but his eyes. As soon as Heinrik appeared, he looked in and met the glance his way. His eyes gleamed.
        
        Sparing a glance ahead of him where the pattering feet had gone, Heinrik slipped into the room and made his way next to Berry. As he sat, he held to the arm of the chair, smiling. "How was your evening?"
        
        With a charming smile and setting down his needle, the dreaming one cocked his head and leaned aside to be closer. "Always a few dreams left."
        
        Heinrik chuckled. But as a thought occurred to him, his gaze wandered and with a tilt of his head, he questioned, "Have you ever thought what would happen if there weren't any dreams left?"
        
        Berry reclined, smiling to himself and at the question. Even if he wondered though, he knew there was no end, there never could be an end. "I always have dreams."
        
        Heinrik peered at him.
        
        "Because I'm happy. As long as we're safe and home, I will always have something to dream about."
        
        Heinrik reached out and took his hand.
        
        Berry looked at him. Though he felt there could never be an end, as he looked at Heinrik, he continued to ponder the question, and with it, an understanding of the never-can-be and the possible-could-be. The sudden burst of laughter down the corridor was distant, almost non-existent like waves on seawater. A happiness that can never end, a great sadness that could be. Without thinking, he squeezed Heinrik's hand, holding onto him, and though Heinrik understood, he lowered his head and waited as Berry continued to wonder along the line between never and the possible. "Maybe money."
        
        Heinrik snorted. He did not expect that. "And what would the money be for?"
        
        Berry raised his head and looked to the distant corner, unseeing, thinking. "I think, if ever I couldn't dream, I would like the money to have one more dream."
        
        Heinrik leaned in, searching Berry's face. "What would you spend the money on?"
        
        Berry peered back at him. "It's not for me."
        
        "The children?"
        
        Berry nodded. "Of course. If I can't dream anymore, then. That seems unfair."
        
        Heinrik smiled. "Isn't every parent's next dream their children?"
        
        Berry sighed and looked back at Heinrik. "But can money really bring dreams to those who would dream?"
        
        "Depends."
        
        "On?"
        
        "If they could dream to begin with." Heinrik smiled and leaned in to look in the eyes of his dreaming one. "I think it's time for another dream. Don't you?"
        
        Berry smiled back, and for a moment, locked eyes with Heinrik, then cried out, "Bedtime!"
        
        There was silence. The two men laughed to themselves, knowing exactly what was going on in their kids' minds, especially the youngest, and as they expected, she squealed, breaking the silence and in her wake as she dashed for the stairs, all her siblings began talking, scrambling, complaining, and shouting, to which Berry shushed them.
        
        He listened, a smile spreading on his lips, and turned to Heinrik. "You're cleaning up tonight." Heinrik stiffened as Berry stood and followed after their children. With a sigh, Heinrik stood and lumbered after him. He massaged the back of his neck and called out, "You're getting the cushions!" He thought about it. "Please!"
        
        All he heard was a bout of laughter upstairs.
        
        "Pillow fight."`

        text: `Floriena sat pinboard straight, hand gripping her beer glass, eyes closed. She looked a figure of stone, her expression of another class in direct contrast with her surroundings. As people danced, whooped and hollered, as boots stomped and a man crooned with the band, she was motionless and solemn. The servers were aware, stealing glances at her as they passed. She was the only sitting patron in her area of the bar.

        Everyone who had been at her table was among the dancers, the audience sitting around on the stools, slapping their thighs, chugging their beers, and mumbling along to the music. She was alone, and they knew. There were caught glances sent her way as others in her party met the gaze of a passing server.
        
        "You alone, lady?"
        
        Floriena opened her eyes and peered to her side. There was a teenage boy sitting at the other table. He had sounded younger than he looked. She stared at him, then looked back down to her glass and closed her eyes.
        
        The boy looked at the crowd. He stole a glance at her.
        
        "Yes."
        
        He stiffened. "Sorry, lady?"
        
        She opened her eyes, staring at the leather of the seat opposite of her. "I said yes."
        
        "Oh." He gulped, for a moment wondering why he had dared. "Don't you want to—"
        
        "No."
        
        He stared at her. "Then why—"
        
        Her gaze never wavered and her hand never loosened its grip on the beer glass.
        
        "Uh. Why are you here?"
        
        "My party is dancing."
        
        He looked around, his mind blank with the processing of the empty chairs and seats surrounding her, the half-filled and empty glasses, recently made stains from food and drinks. As another holler rose from the dancers and patrons from the other tables, he said mindlessly, "Shouldn't you dance too." When he glanced at the woman, he found her glaring and instinctively leaned back.
        
        "If I could," she said slowly, "I would leave. Right. Now."
        
        "So why—"
        
        She snapped her glare at him. He shrank back.
        
        "Do you hear him?"
        
        His brows scrunched together. He gazed back at her confused, shaking his head as if he were cowering.
        
        She rolled her eyes and looked away. "The crooner."
        
        He looked to the band at the man who was looking to the bass player, currently plucking through a solo, stomping his feet with a wide grin and a steady clap of the beat.
        
        "He won't stop."
        
        "Should he?"
        
        Her eyes narrowed. "He'll keep singing, even after no one is dancing anymore or the bar is empty."
        
        "You're waiting for him?"
        
        "Unfortunately."
        
        "Why don't you. Could just grab him. Happens all the time, you know."
        
        She closed her eyes and sighed through her nose. When she opened her eyes again, her gaze had softened. She looked defeated.
        
        "You really won't stop him."
        
        She shook her head and for once, loosened her grip on the beer glass. "I won't."
        
        The boy watched her closely and sat back, waiting, feeling that if he waited, she might say at least one thing more. He was right.
        
        "I can't make him happy, not long enough to distract him, so he keeps singing. He'll keep going. Even when his players have become tired and the night has mellowed and the people start to leave."
        
        "Why does he keep singing? That's kind of..."
        
        She cracked a smile and leaned her head away, staring at the leather seat opposite of her. "He doesn't want to forget the sister he lost two months ago."
        
        "Oh."
        
        She nodded and peered down at her beer glass. For the first time in two hours, she raised the glass for a sip that became a gulp and she chugged down the rest.
        
        "You think he'll ever—"
        
        Glass empty, she set it down with a thud and wiped her mouth with the back of her wrist, yet she managed to retain the refined and solemn look she had as she stared at the leather seat. "I hope," she said with a finality that sank in his gut, "I hope he never stops. What am I supposed to do if he stops—what would it mean if he stopped. Did he forget, did he move on, has he healed, has he given up. If he never stops, he can remember and he can cry and he can be happy in his grief—it's better than what else he could do. So I will never take that from him."
        
        The boy nodded to himself, sliding back and got ready to stand, only to stop. He peered at the woman who did not respond or look at him. "You should be okay too." Her eyes twitched, not quite narrowing, but she did not answer. He hurried away and in his wake, his words settled and sank in. Her hand released the glass and her shoulders drooped. With a deep breath, she closed her eyes and pulled her hands down, grasping them together as she buried them between her thighs. She let her head fall.
        
        To the servers, it looked as if she had fallen asleep. The teenage boy who had talked to her, standing among the other servers, couldn't tell if he felt guilty or sad. With a bump on his shoulder, he turned and disappeared in the kitchen.`
