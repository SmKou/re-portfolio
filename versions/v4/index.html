                <h3>Seattle, 2022</h3>
                <p>The boy walked with his head down, his large sleeve covering his hand as he held his mother's. She spoke softly. He gave no responses, looking like he might skip in his steps, a boredom he kept in pace.</p>

                <p>The young woman appeared twice. She stood with her friend, the two seemingly trying to figure out where to go, standing on the platform. Then they were there at the bus stop, waiting in line.</p>

                <p>Across from the station, the woman stopped and rummaged around in her bag. She'd been looking around, but then focused on looking, head down, gaze to the ground.</p>
                <p>Let me be honest. As I was moving, I didn't have enough time to observe them. I passed by the boy as I was crossing the crosswalk and turned right, veering towards the station entrance, while he and his mom stopped at the light. Arriving at the station at the end of the line, I saw that the escalator was in repair and veered straight to the stairs at the end of the platform. The young woman passed me on the platform, and I thought she would cross the bridge, so I didn't bother looking at her ensemble, but as the bus arrived, I found her waiting beside the sign. Then, as the bus was pulling away, I spotted the woman at the other end of the ST express bus terminal. The boy, the young woman, and the woman each got a second glimpse, a second chance to remember their colors, the textures of their clothing.</p>

                <p>The woman walked with her hands stuffed in her pockets, flanked on either side by a pair who were both taller than her. The woman to her left wore business casual, while the man to her right wore spring casual. As they trudged uphill side-by-side, the man would step out and lean towards the street, while the woman to the left teetered from side to side with each step. As they passed by a back alley, water flowed along the sidewalk in streams,  heading towards the curb. She tiptoed and stepped over the widest stream and continued her steady pace up the hill, only uttering confirmations that she was listening. The other two were the ones speaking, back and forth, as the man told a story.</p>

                <h3>Seattle, 2021</h3>
                <p>The woman sits in her chair, looking for a corner she can hide in. Looking around and hardly ever saying a word, she keeps one leg crossed over the other, sometimes bouncing her foot. She has three plastic bags, full of things she has collected around the shelter. When she moves, she hangs the bags along one arm and drags her chair behind her as she moves from one room to the next. She may mutter to herself, but mostly, with her hood drawn and surveying the people with sideways glances, she looks for a spot away from them all. Sometimes, she sits in the corner by the coffee machine, wedged between the windows overlooking the patio and the counters and cabinets at the back. That's where she sleeps, upright with two mats folded and pressed against the wall. Usually, during the day, she sits on the opposite side of the room against the wall with her bags beside her beside the cart for the tables, when they're folded and stacked for the night. Once, she sat in the doorway to the laundry room. Another time, she sat in the doorway to the computer room. Rarely does she set up her chair in the hallway like the rest of the women, yet she stands and watches, and shuffles aside if one says "excuse me" nicely.</p>
