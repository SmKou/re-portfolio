On the metro bout 10 min ago, if not 15, I watched a young man and woman climb on, and at once the woman was held in the man's arms as he bore the incoming crowd at his back. It was admirable and reminded me of some movie, 
though it tends to be common here, though usually in some corner. These two stood right at the door.

I found it interesting and with the tightness of surrounding bodies, I was made to look at this guy, and for the most part, I did try to look away, but there's only so much I can do if wanting to see something clearly requires craning my neck, so I looked at him.

The guy had coarse, scraggly hair combed forward. His face was broad and flat, his lips large--the kind for sloppy wet kisses, which I find fairly disgusting, and his nose was flat apart from a small lump on its crooked length and flaring 
nostrils. In a certain light, he could be attractive, but his appeal would be selective.

As for the young woman he held in his arms. She was as slim and thin as most young women here seem to be. She had straight bangs and two braids falling down her back. Her shirt had a round collar, exposing the curve of her neck. Apart from how her jaw moved and it seemed she was whispering and her boyfriend had the most unwelcoming expression of sheer indifference while holding her close, this is all I saw.

Odd couple. It's heartwarming, I would think, but I just found them interesting. I feel, though, that others would find them, in a sense, heartwarming.
