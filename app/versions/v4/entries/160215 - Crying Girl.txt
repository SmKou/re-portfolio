A little girl with a very long plump face is crying here on the subway train. Her cries sound like gritty, heaved groans. When first everyone barged into the car and scrambled to secure a seat, this girl and her mother soon followed, easily walking in and stepping up to the bench because most everyone will give up a seat to a child here in China. It has been 5 minutes and the child continues to wail. It's not that hard to ignore, but what intrigued me was when she first started crying as if she were devastated greatly by something. She was directing her cries at her mother, making them more poignant and disruptive. Her mother was unfazed. She watched her little girl cry and after three heaving sobs that garnered no results, the girl wiped her own tears. Turning away, she persisted in crying, but the sound was not as gritting on the ear. She was crying to herself.

Another interesting thing happened less than a few minutes ago. As the girl consented to sitting on her mom's lap and started to calm down, the doors soon opened to the next station. An old man of crinkled appearance, snaggle-toothed, worn, sun-burnt and freckled and moled, he stopped at me first. I thought he waited on me to give up my seat, but then he looked away and I saw his gaze was directed more towards the side of the bench with the girl and mother. He approached them and offered the girl a folded, previously rolled newspaper. She took it and calmed down from then on.

That was very strange to me.

Thinking of that little girl, I also remember a woman I saw, back in China, on September 18th, 2016.
