Two things today. I work in Taihe, about an hour from the city center by metro and an additional 20 min by motorbike. While I could go by bus from that stop, that takes longer and riding the motorbike is my guilty little pleasure. So much so that I have a small handful of drivers who recognize me on sight, such that I need only walk 
up to them and hop on the bike, instructions not required. This is only true in the morning though. For the trip back, I have always ridden with whichever driver is available, yet for the first time, today, as I climbed onto the back of a 
motorbike, another came up to me. The driver looked at me and seemed familiar with me. I could not recognize him, but he whispered to me. I felt like a woman caught by her boyfriend going out with another man. Awkward. And since that was so not the case, so terribly weird, then funny.

I'll have to see next week if he's there again. Hope he's not the driver who takes the long ass detour. That would be awkward indefinitely.

Number two. While on the way to the metro station, we passed a boy on a bike heading the other way. I thought he had a bag in front of him, dangling over the handle bars but it was another boy, one I figured was a little smaller since it seemed impossible with two boys of the same size. Somehow, I felt very self satisfied when I affirmed this idea at that time. But here's what really caught my attention. The other boy draped over the boys hid his head in the way a sick person does. Split second impression, unwell, whereas behind him, the boy driving the bike was all smiles. He was looking around in a daze, apparently amazed by something as if admiring fireflies hovering about him. As I thought about them, I figured the other boy was just sleeping, but what an idea to be driving someone unwell and looking about in wonder.

Wish I had a story to put these things in.
