It was something about her eyes and face that compelled me to take a picture. She is not beautiful, not by my usual definition, but then, my usual definition is subject to bias favoring nature and human expression.

The way the light caught in her eyes. A white square appeared in the corner of murky brown irises and glowed. With her features that seem to slope like mountains and slant like the strokes of Chinese characters, she gained a surreal air...

The woman's face was long, drawn down into the jaw that was heavy and reminiscent of a horse. Raven black hair fell down the sides of her face and shoulders, swishing as the bus jerked, and as she watched the outside, light flared in her murky brown irises. At first, she seemed to be squinting, her eyes with their long downy lashes appearing near slits, but as she raised her chin, the squares of light appeared, illuminating the brown irises.
