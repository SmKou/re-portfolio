The tiny stones were practically imperceptible on the fine-banded ring she wore. I do not know if the stones were turquoise, purple, or black, yet the woman presented her hand beneath the camera of her mobile phone, resting it lightly in her boyfriend's as if brandishing an engagement ring. Perhaps it was a promise ring, though it rested on her middle finger. Over her boyfriend's hand which came up in the picture as if to grab a giant pearl in his grasp, it looked like a monster stretching forth its red-skinned claw to seize her. His hand was so red, that the redness could either be mistaken for overheating or a blush reaching from head to toe. What a strange thing to see...

Pleasantries exist for people to say something in an otherwise awkward situation. Yesterday, I saw a woman lounging in a red velvet chair and a short time later, I found a second woman had sat down and proceeded to nap as well. It occurred to me that they could be strangers. What if it was normal to nap in public and wake up with a stranger opposite of you as if they are your company, or have become your company upon the two of you waking?

The two stir... 
"[Good waking]. How was your nap?" "Good, and yours?" "Good."

The whole point of greetings is to have something to say when one encounters another.
