I know it was awfully mean of me.

I was standing on the edge of the crosswalk, waiting for the light to turn, I noticed a pair of women in white and pink. From their shoulders to the hem of the dress and the skirt, their clothes were infested with holes as if someone had embroidered a screen and then removed the screen. All white and all pink.

It was two of those kinds of apparel where the knitting patterns speak for themselves. At a glance, I saw them and dismissed them, but my attention soon returned to them, wondering why they were interesting to me as they searched the street and spared glances at the building behind me. Then I noticed the face of the woman in pink and the only way I could describe her was as if someone had flat-ironed the top of her face. Beneath her thick, penciled brows, her eyes were flat and wide, exaggerated by shades of blue and silver (I'm guessing) and so were her cheekbones, but then her nose ballooned out, as did the flare of her cheeks and jaw, rising over the rolled flatness. Even her brows jutted out and her forehead sloped. Only her eyes and cheekbones were so flat that I imagined someone taking an iron to her face years ago and pressing hard with the heated steel, and I was so convinced by my own notion of her flatness that for a moment, I was genuinely searching for the burn marks such an injury would have surely left.

There was none of course, and I want to say I feel bad. I feel awful because one should never perceive another's face the way I did. But with all I've thought and written before, it's really too late to become polite about it.
