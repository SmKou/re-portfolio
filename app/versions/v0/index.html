                <h3>Logician (INTP-A)</h3>
                <p>Logicians love patterns and spotting discrepancies between statements could almost be described as a hobby, making it a bad idea to lie to a Logician. This makes it ironic that Logicians' word should always be taken with a grain of salt. It's not that they're dishonest but that they tend to share thoughts that are not fully developed, using others as a sounding board for ideas and theories in a debate against themselves.</p>
                <p>Assertive logicians are more likely to be comfortable with themselves and proud of who they are. Whether assertive or turbulent, they are prone to change directions (or methods) often. They rarely become so set on one concept they stop considering all other possibilities. However, an assertive logician is less likely to make a decision they know they will regret.</p>

                <h3>Mastermind | Maverick Leader</h3>
                <p>The mastermind is methodical, intense, self-reliant, understated and complex. When surrounded by certainty, they remain rational and grounded. They use a no-nonsense approach to life and work. The primary advantage of the mastermind is power (lead with command), their secondary being mystique (communicate with substance).</p>
                <p>The maverick leader is pioneering, irreverent, entrepreneurial, artful and dramatic. They are unafraid to take the lead and happy to propose a new direction for a product or market strategy. The primary advantage of the maverick leader is innovation (change with creativity), while their secondary is power (lead with command).</p>

                <h3>Rational Architect</h3>
                <p>Rationals tend to be pragmatic, skeptical, self-contained and focused on problem-solving and systems analysis. They pride themselves on being ingenious, independent and strong-willed. Even-tempered individuals, they trust logic and yearn for achievement. They seek knowledge, prize technology and dream of understanding how the world works.</p>
                <p>Among rationals, architects are master designers for all kinds of theoretical systems, including school curricula, corporate strategies, and new technologies. For Architects, the world exists primarily to be analyzed, understood, explained, and re-designed. External reality in itself is unimportant, little more than raw material to be organized
                into structural models.</p>
