# v0: The Profile

## Description

The very first portfolio consists of bits and pieces, rather than any specific notion or design. This is why it's version 0. Since all the pieces seem to be parts of a profile, this page has been designed to replicate an old facebook profile (2005).

### Content
- personality: personality quiz imgs, personality quiz text
- appearance: makeup design imgs
- status
- favorites

**Essential question**: What interests would I not mind others knowing?

### Design
- sidebar: logo-img, search bar, page menu
- main
  - facebook action bar
  - facebook profile bar
  - left third: profile img, status, posts, groups
  - right two-thirds: name and background, mini-feed

Colors:
- background: white
- text: blue and white
- elements: blue (gradients)
