                    <summary>Why take a programming class? (2023)</summary>
                    <p><strong>Why would someone take a programming class?</strong></p>
                    <p>The reasons for taking a class on any subject can be determined by one's motivations or interests. In questions using "would", there is sometimes the sense that "would" can be replaced by "should" or by "would want". A person should take a class on programming because it is practice in patience, thinking logically and breaking down concepts and processes into their constituent ideas and actions. Should their class allow, a person would even have practice in understanding and navigating intricate systems. As for why a person would want to, taking a class on programming can be a matter of fulfilling personal achievement and curiosity, expanding personal growth and options, or to improve one's value or contributions, whether intended or not, by learning a skill that by learning is a practice in problem solving and multifactor analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why would I take a class on programming?</strong></p>
                    <p>Given that the reasons for taking a class on any subject can be determined by one's motivations or interests, here, I would say I have both the motivation and the interest. Some of my motivations contain a history, others are more immediate.</p>
                    <p>My interest is programming. It has been a hobby of mine since my teenage years to design systems, services and devices, and later to develop prototypes. While my interest in designing devices waned, I still enjoy analyzing, studying and redesigning systems and services. However, I never liked working in design, partly because of personal limitations.</p>
                    <p>Being around people for more than two hours makes me very sick from physical and emotional stress. Communicating on the phone or by voice and video extends that window of time to about a full day's work, so it makes sense to pursue an occupation that can be done remotely for most of the time. Part of the reason I am taking a programming class is to pursue a career in web development. My other reasons are more personal and have a greater history.</p>

                    <summary>How can pronouns be perceived? (2023)</summary>
                    <p>I have a habit of omitting personal pronouns from sentences. I find personal pronouns annoying. My issue with them is a matter of linguistics and its relationship with psychology. In languages structured around nouns and with the subject first, speakers are more likely to think first of sources, rather than of actions and causes. To exacerbate this, in cultures that are more people-focused and individualistic, speakers are more inclined first to identify individuals and pursue blame or individual action to solve or address an incident. While I know language and culture are not completely at fault for these traits, these systems structure the mind and one's personal experiences, and present the first limitation, even obstacle, in one's capacity for common understanding.</p>
                    <p>There is also another reason though. When personal pronouns are removed, questions like the one above can more easily be interpreted in multiple ways. For the question above, I addressed two of them: one, "Why did [I] take a class on programming" and two, "Why [would someone] take a class on programming. There is no shortage online of answers addressing either interpretation, so initially, I [was] not inclined to provide my own answer. What I would do is try to structure an answer based on what I've read and observed before, but this is rather erroneous since I have a very poor memory and since I look up and read so many things in a day, it all gets pretty jumbled in my head. [Nevertheless, I atttempted to provide an answer.]</p>
